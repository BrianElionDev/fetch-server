    "transcript": "it's time for my most important video of the year or potentially my most important video for the next four years and that's because today I'm going to be giving you a complete overview of my portfolio for 2024 I'm going to be explaining to you why I'm buying what I'm buying the odds that I see of this bet working out and of course my plan to eventually sell these assets for what I hope will be a life-changing amount of money but it's time to get real here and talk about the brass tax I'm going to be going into the hot narratives gaming AI layer ones and helping you pull apart and understand exactly why I believe these projects are going to win now in December of 2020 I did a similar video and I called out axi Infiniti on December 7th 2020 the price of axi Infiniti was about 55 and it went on to Peak here at $160 that my friends is not a 100x that is a 300X now beyond that you you know that I've called some of the absolute biggest most face melting gainers of 2023 a year in which most people told us that Bitcoin and all of crypto was going to zero Bitcoin will go to zero and we proved them wrong in fact I do believe that this channel has nailed it more so than almost any other in the entire crypto space but it's time to get real all of this crypto stuff is a massive risk that's why there's the potential upside for literally life-changing gains in the short amount of time when you compare it to any other industry that also means you got to be prepared for that downside even the best projects in this space could crash 70 80 90% in fact some of these projects are so degenerate that you must seek medical help if you want to actually buy them literally the only way you'll be able to view yourself if you lose money here is with clown makeup and a wig so if we're going to do this crypto thing you got to put on your big boy pants you got to take responsibility for each and every coin you buy and most important importantly you have to have a plan why are you buying it what do you believe the valuation for this asset could be and when at what price points will you sell this thing because if you can't answer those questions you are forever going to be fish food to the sharks swimming around you in the crypto waterers now let's talk about the first thing which is why right now is actually really good timing now Bitcoin does this thing where it goes on a four-year cycle it has three good years and then one terrible year the problem is that most people get in when Bitcoin is at the Apex of that one candle they get in at the top when everybody's screaming about crypto how they made all this money Dogecoin Millionaires and so on and so forth the higher Bitcoin and crypto goes in price the more dangerous it is that it could drop in price of course if you flip that around the lower it goes the safer it is to buy and the more likely you are to get the good price close to the bottom and that's why we were buying as soon as we saw some good indications out of the FED when they stepped in and started saving banks in March that's when we hopped in here and said hey look I think think that these bailouts are going to create more liquidity and form a bottom I think the bleed is over and it's time to start allocating even though it feels uncomfortable and it will feel uncomfortable even in these bull runs there are crazy dips as my buddy Alex Becker would say my co-founder in neotokyo this is a chart you're going to see everywhere where you see the massive sell-offs that happened all the way up during the 2017 rally the fact is that bull runs are actually the time to buy the dip bare markets are where you sell the rally if you think about it the overall trend is up so you want to buy as it comes down cuz you know it's going to go back up or at least you have a good idea that the trend will continue remember the trend is your friend and the same is true of the bare Market while things are macro going down you want to sell them as they rally up cuz that's your chance to get out at a good price now I wanted to add in here that Bitcoin is now in a dip and the whole Market has pretty much taken a massive dip well not every coin of course beam and immutable X are still crushing it but you you know most of the coins here have taken a bit of a dip there's plenty of coins in the red here over the last few days and honestly it's kind of popping up right now so you know it's at 42,000 if it gets back above this you know $43,000 Mark or so you know if it gets back Above This 425 or specifically above 43 44 this dip is over right this is going to to new highs for the year what I want to impress upon you is this dips are effectively the thing that you want you don't want to just be chasing when things are up up and away that might feel like the best time to invest it certainly is the most exciting but what you really want to wait for are the times that it's not exciting again so if this dip gets worse goes down into the 30s or so maybe even the low3s that would not be the end of times now it would be very concerning if we go below you know 31,000 or 32,000 that is a very sensitive area and might signal a much more difficult time for Bitcoin ahead really all of crypto but in the case of right now anything above 32,000 to me is a massive massive opportunity if it comes down and the more uncomfortable it gets the more the Bears come out of their caves and start screaming it was all a dream this was the biggest bull trap in the history of the world well that to me my friends is the time that all be looking to smash the buy button but again I'm not doing too much right now I've been buying throughout 2023 and so I'm pretty well positioned here coming into 2024 but I hope this video helps you out a lot and back to the analysis so the point is right now we are still in this three candle which is right before the two most parabolic years the two best years of the Bitcoin cycle that is if the cycle is to continue to play out the way it worked before now a lot of people don't believe in this cycle stuff but get this you want to see something crazy from the all-time low in 2015 to the all-time high in 2017 it was exactly 1,64 days from the all-time high in 2017 to the all-time low in 2018 it was exactly 364 days from all-time low in 2018 to alltime high in 2021 1, 64 days again exactly the time from low to high and then once again from all-time high in November of 2021 to alltime low in November of 2022 364 days honestly some things are Stranger Than Fiction and Bitcoin very well might be one of those maybe we're all in a simulation maybe this is all some collective delusion maybe there are no coins at all what I do know is that as long as this Bitcoin cycle continues to show itself and prove itself out as it has once again in 2023 I feel like I would be a damn fool not to bet hard on the industry that I log into and talk about and obsess over every single day so that's what I'm doing but make no mistake this is risky business and everything you buy into could be manipulated crash the founders could end up not being honorable or doing the right thing the code could get hacked stuff is very very risky and you assume a 70 to 100% loss whenever you buy anything in this crypto space the trade-off here is you're trading a 70% downside for a potential thousand or 10,000% upside that's 10 to 100x upside versus a near total loss those are better odds than you're going to get in Vegas almost any day of the week and for that reason I'm all in on crypto gambling to make my life better and if you're here in crypto right now watching a video like this you need to slam down some hard to swallow pills and understand that you're gambling too well to be fair we all need to gamble that's what the Fiat system forces us to do cuz your money turns to dust in your wallet your labor is not worth anything anymore we need to gamble in stocks in real estate in assets of some kind if you want to get ahead and to me crypto is the one that I know and it's the one that I think is the most generous and most likely to help people Achieve Financial Freedom so I'm gambling here and with that said let's get to my portfolio for 2024 of course we should add that Michael sailor the biggest bull on Wall Street believes Bitcoin will hit a $350,000 price in 2024 now that would mean that Bitcoin is about 10x from here of course what we saw over the last one was Bitcoin went about 3x over its prior all-time high now if Bitcoin goes to 350k that would mean it would do a 5x over its prior all-time high whereas last cycle it did about a 3 and 1/2x over its prior alltime high so it's going way higher and that would mean that what we'd see out of total three meaning the altcoins would probably be even more dramatic right we saw a gain here of total three which went from about 300 billion up to 1.3 trillion this was about a 212% gain or almost a 3X out of the altcoins now if we go 50% more that means we could see about a 4X out of the altcoins from prior all-time high and that would mean altcoins alone would be at $4.5 trillion doll not to mention you add in Bitcoin and eth you have crypto scratching its head on nearly $1 trillion in market value that my friends is the size of gold and that my friends is a whole new ball game as they would say and as always I solicited the community I said I'm doing my 2024 portfolio video this week what coins should I include and I literally in a few hours got almost 1,000 responses and they were really bad they were terrible I am not taking advice from you guys ever again I don't know what you're trying to do to me but please God stop trying to give me Alpha because it is not working anyway back to the show all right let's get into it this is going to be a complete breakdown of the 2024 portfolio and I'm not going to give you exact percentage size of these tokens but I'm going to give you a general idea on how I'm organizing my portfolio as a whole and then I'm going to give you the actual products within each category and this is going to be an absolutely monstrous amount of information so get ready smash that like button and make sure you're subscribed with the Bell notification on each video we've come out with over the past few weeks I've been trying to make sure that they are so loaded with information that they are effectively unmissable okay the first one where we started doing this was 185k views we're going to have our first video Hit 200k K views in what feels like years I'm sure it has been and every single video here I've been pouring my heart and soul into making sure that they are jam-packed with Alpa so make sure you put the Bell notification on because everything I put out on this channel going forward will be in my opinion required viewing you absolutely must watch this stuff if you want to be ahead of crypto no channel is covering these niches and these movements like I am and I'm giving this all to you for free and I'm trying to make sure that I don't waste any of your time here so hit that Bell notification and you will be in my opinion way ahead of everyone else but again as I go through these coins I want to be very clear I will explain my logic as to why I like these coins but in the end this community is getting so big and so many people know about the strength of this community that inevitably if you're following the coins here only on this list then you're always going to be late I want you to take the ideas here the mental models of how I'm finding and analyzing coins in this market which I explained in detail and I want you to apply them on your own and that way you can be ahead instead of buying a YouTuber coin like I'm going to be covering here it's going to allow you to get ahead of everyone else but only if you do these things and do the hard work on your own with that said I hope this information helps you now starting at the top we have salana okay this is a risk ranking and by the way you see my technicolored risk ranking chart here again this is completely made up right I'm just trying to give you a sense here of where the the bigger risks are uh blue chips and the medium and the medium highs those are just going to be lower gains there's still a ton of risk in those coins right everything has risk in this industry could get sued by the government founder could die you never know crazy world lot of smells Anything Could Happen okay but anyway enough of that salana you guys know my thesis here salana is the best competitor to ethereum and everything in the salana ecosystem Has Gone Bananas I started giving you guys salana in the teens in the low 20s and it has absolutely crushed it it peaked I think at about $75 um I'm just calling my ET call here 17 though I know I talked about it around the 13 range I just think I was more forceful around the $17 range and so the gains so far are 321 per or 4.21 x's and the downside and this is how I'm calculating this the downside is the 2023 low so the low value in 2023 I don't think the market goes and revisits those I think that's a hard bottom and so my logic is your downside in this category is effectively the current value and that is divided by the or the the 2023 low divided by the current value and that allows you to see effectively how low you could go if we revisit those lows which is possible right if there's some apocalyptic scenario and Bitcoin just shreds through 32k and everything turns out to be a massive bull trap and kappo was right well I guess this is possible right we could go revisit those 2023 lows so I'm just showing you your max downside but just know essentially salana has taken on this super Blue Chip status as a testament to that projects like gito which are essentially like Lio or Flash Bots in the salana ecosystem are being valued at multi-billion dollars that's $3 billion fdv for a project like jeto which arguably might be seen as too much too soon but it just shows you how significant the salana ecosystem is that people are valuing uh the coins in the salana ecosystem as equal to their ethereum counterparts and that's a massive narrative so like I said I'll be rotating profits from trades into salana as part of my strategy and that is one that I keep getting laughed at in the YouTube comments so if you want to keep laughing at me go ahead I appreciate it every time I've been laughed at and mocked for my choices that I'm making publicly here for you all it's turned out to be a massive Money Maker so reply guys eat your heart out because you are my best indicator that I'm doing something right I know it's a hard pill to swallow but we have a lot of coins to get through so we are going to start getting through them the second one is chain link again chain link is one of the most important protocols in the entire space they're integrating with swift that's right the banking Swift they are one of the most legitimate ways to communicate between chains and protocols if you have dexes that are feeding in prices well they're using an Oracle and that is coming in through chain link chain link is effectively part of most if not all of Defi and it is a blue chip by all standards again Blue Chips they have a potential for maybe a 10x or so from here maybe a 15x in a very good situation but they're also lower risk they're not going to dump as fast they have much more significant holder bases and chain link is definitely a blue Blue Chip to have on your radar it's part of my portfolio and if you want a more passive portfolio things like salana and chain link are definitely in that lower crypto risk almost guaranteed to be here for the next several years if not on into the future next we have coinbase as you know I'm a big bull on coinbase stock after the fall of CZ and FTX they are the last man standing and they are the white knight of crypto publicly listed on the stock market I've been aping coinbase like a madman since about $60 here $65 is when I covered it on the channel and that would mean that we're about 2.1x over my call and I keep adding to my coinbase position just cuz it's really easy to do for my bank I have sort of my Fiat and crypto worlds separated and it's a really nice easy thing to do that I've been rotating out of my treasury bills and into coinbase stock largely from my treasury bills and it's been an insane play I also think coinbase is a blue chip in that it's not going to do more than a 10x here in fact if it hits $1,000 I would be kind of mind blown I think that that's possible in like a total blowoff top but really I'm just hoping it makes new highs around $500 to $1,000 at the end of the cycle in 20125 that would be a blessing and I think that that is a peak price for coinbase this is the only stock you're going to see here but it trades like a crypto so of course if you want something more passive these are things you can just buy and know they're going to be here years from now and probably going to grow with the cycle now we get into something a little more spicy which is Avalanche as you guys know I've been a big Avalanche bull throughout the years I was first on avax in 2021 one I was one of the first YouTubers to bring avax and the avax ecosystem coins like Joe and some other Crazy Ones to the frame here Joe's like the Unis swap of avalanche again Avalanche is to me the next in line after salana as far as hyped layer one ecosystems and it is slightly off of Blue Chip it's not a blue chip it's a medium risk and just to show you here it's been tracking actually the gains of salana really really well if you look here soul is about 73% off its high Avalanche through most of the markets about 74% off its alltime high it was almost identical in its percent draw down from alltime high for the entirety of the bare market and so these two will probably make their way up to alltime high in a similar fashion and if you really study the actual movements Avalanche is a really interesting evm Tech again the layer one ecosystem has a ton of competition there are so many chains now but I just think there's some muscle memory in the charts here because Solana Luna and avax were like the trio of 2021 obviously Luna nuked and doesn't really exist anymore but salana and avac when salana makes a really big run avac seems to want to play catchup and look what is a medium risk goated L1 if you don't have polygon now polygon markets itself as a layer two but it really kind of in practice is a layer one though they are starting to connect the dots here with their cdk right so they have this chain development kit where they effectively allow people to launch their own ZK EVMS now this is very next gen and it's in fact the technology that underpins the newest initiative from immutable X which is of course also on this list and a project that we'll talk about shortly but together this is part of the three-headed dragon of gaming and polygon is beyond that it's also really good Tech and I know this from my developer friends which throughout 2021 really didn't like the technology that underpinned polygon they've made big strides and in my opinion their ZK Tech has started to become best-in-class and really next gen so it's something to consider that polygon and their technology keeps evolving and they're about to evolve from the madic token to the pole token again showing their firm transition to ZK rollup technology this is something to keep your eyes on and I have no reason to believe that polygon won't have a massive run in 2024 with the rest of the market again this thing went on 300X it was trading between 1 and 5 cents when I was covering it like crazy in 2019 and 2020 and in 2021 it went on its hallowed run up to $3 it's pretty insane next one up is injective and in this case you want to trust the strength of the chart look at this this is one of the best performing assets of the entire market and one of the few that has actually broken its prior all-time high you can see its prior alltime high was about 24 bucks here and today it is sitting at $26 this is the way that you understand that strength begets strength and obviously we've talked about injective in fact we were one of the first people to cover injective at the beginning of the 2021 run at the end of 2020 we covered injective at 70 I actually participated in the early token sale and was able to get tokens at 70 here and we rode this thing up as a community up to $22 absolutely astronomical but look it takes a very special type of team to be one of the first to overcome your prior highs in the new cycle and this chart is screaming that it wants to remain strong so again injective is a defi protocol is part of the cosmos ecosystem and you'd be a fool to fade this kind of strength in a new cycle next we have Celestia now Celestia is like a nerds Paradise again in the cosmos ecosystem both of these are they are their own layer ones and again I put them as medium high because they are newer Kids on the Block they are not as established as Avalanche they are not as established as polygon they do not have as many fundamentals driving them in fact Celestia's brand new and trading like an absolute beast but at the same time I think Celestia's Tech is very exciting to people and the strength of its chart simply cannot be denied I mean essentially it doesn't really know how to take a dip it's absolutely crazy obviously we talked about it here at about four bucks I had people talking to me about it at $2 but I missed that move and as you you can see the strength is just undeniable even when Bitcoin had this dip it just exploded upwards it shows you that there's true demand here for Celestia some additional Alpha here is that I'm hearing that there's going to be a ton of Celestia airdrops so if you're staking Celestia you'll get a ton of these projects that are launching on Celestia essentially giving you free tokens air drops so if you're staking the Tia coin then you could be eligible for some aird drops again this is all early Alpha but in addition they have a 16% APR so you stake you get some Celestial rewards and then you get some free tokens on top of it if this thing moons like crazy it could be one of the gigabrain plays of the cycle I'm certainly hoping it is now the last one is internet computer and what's crazy about this chart is I don't think I've seen a worst looking chart in my whole life like it is easily the worst looking chart of all charts however that is actually kind of a benefit when you zoom in you realize that almost all their tokens are in market right they have a total supply of 510 they have 450 circulating that's like I don't know 80 or 90% there and so there's not a lot of inflation and this thing went through this crazy crazy dump where effectively everyone got mad and sold and its reputation went down but meanwhile they kept developing stuff and it's got this decentralized storage play that I actually think makes it slightly different than other layer ones it's not directly competing with the likes of soul and stuff who knows anyway I have some internet computer in my portfolio cuz I think there's a chance and if you see here it hasn't pumped very much its low was like three bucks it's up at like 5.6 it's not even 2x off its lows and get this the all time high was $700 right it's sitting here at $5 that's literally more than 100x it's n it's over 99% down from its all-time high so if it does go back and tickle its all-time high which I think of as absolutely absurd it probably won't do that well it's just like there's just a lot of room for this thing to go that these are the charts that if they get going could mean business if they get serious again I have a very small amount of my portfolio but I figured it was worth a bet in case this thing does wake up next there's a project called monad it is not released yet it's in my uh unreleased and I just gave it a risk because I don't really know what the risk is cuz I don't know what the price is risk is heavily correlated to price if you don't know what the price is you can't determine the risk but anyway this is an upand cominging project that a lot of people are hyped about and I would not be shocked if this thing ends up catching some serious hype waves if we do get this bull run that we're all really hoping for this is one to have on your list definitely go ahead and follow it the next is layer zero again this is going to be one of the biggest coins in the the whole ecosystem and you can actually likely qualify for their airdrop if you're using their Stargate Finance defi application which allows you to bridge assets between different chains I highly encourage you to understand what layer zero is as this is likely to be one of the biggest token launches in the whole industry coming up soon shout out to the layer zero team because I've actually been collaborating with them on some other stuff again stuff that will be announced in 2024 now I want to be clear those are like the big coins those are the big pieces of tech out here that I want you to be aware of and most of those are lowerer risk and we'll have most likely pretty muted rewards we're not talking about 100 X's here like if Celestia goes 100x it would be worth like a quad zillion dollars that's not going to happen those are maybe 10 to 20x plays at the max but probably some of them will be closer to 5x plays in my opinion having too much of your crypto portfolio tied up in 5x plays feels like a waste that's my particular approach and to explain this in a little more depth I'm breaking out my portfolio breakdown which is in the end I have a lot of money in Treasures which I'm actually rotating quite a bit of money out of there because I believe interest rates have peaked and that risk is going to be the new thing to allocate towards that's my particular approach but in the end I have what's called a crypto barbell where on one side of the barbell I have lower risk stuff stuff I know is going to be there for a very long time stuff like Bitcoin stuff like coinbase stock stuff that I don't need to wake up in the middle of the night sweating and think has it all gone to zero has it all just evaporated into dust yeah yes this is the high conviction long-term bucket and in that high conviction long-term bucket we have Bitcoin we have ethereum we have salana and we have coinbase stock and that bucket actually has been updated because coinbase has been ripping salana has been absolutely ripping and this is how my long-term conviction bucket looks now I'm actually rotating profits whenever I do take them into salana that's my personal approach again I might rotate profits into some other exotic L1 if I get really carried away but this is my general plan I'm going to try to stick to my plan as much as I can it's also really important to make plans and write them down because the emotion of the market will carry you off into La La Land if you let it and if you write stuff down you can at least sober up for a second and pull yourself out of the Psychedelic Bull Run acid trip that has long since left planet Earth and you're contemplating whether a dogcoin on butthole chain can be worth $10 trillion because you saw a tick tocker made a Tik Tock about it and you're just wondering what the point of life is because you haven't talked to your friends in months and you stare at a screen all day trading crypto coins that's what the bull Run's like all right you lose your godamn marbles so keep it together all right keep it together and write stuff down all right a little break from the video here because if you're new to crypto you need to have a VPN and that's why I'm extremely proud to partner with nordvpn and be one of their leading Partners in the whole crypto space because if you don't have a VPN you're literally like a lamb to the slaughter here your IP address will start showing up on crypto sites which even though the blockchain is secure those sites could be compromised and your IP address effectively you could become a Target so you want to make sure that you avoid that situation with a product that only cost $3 per month but what's great is you get a massive discount if you use my link below again I was hacked a few months ago and so I take cyber security extremely seriously like I've said many times before you can be forgiven for a lot of mistakes in crypto a lot of them are understandable in fact even ogs make mistakes but one thing you will not be forgiven for is not having a VP VN it's so cheap it's so easy and best of all it supports the channel and I appreciate you guys so check out nordvpn sponsor of today's video and let's get back to some good old fashion cryptocoins back to the point here I personally think that the zero Infinity bucket is worth allocating to now I personally think the zero Infinity bucket has odds that in a bull run make sense because in a bull run if Bitcoin continues to grow usually altcoins will continue to grow especially early on in the bull run and quite Frank Al the risk if Bitcoin doesn't continue to grow is it could drop dramatically I mean bitcoin's up 3x on the year so I mean the thing could drop like 70% and still only be touching its 2023 low that my friends is a huge amount of downside but if you're upside is you know somewhat limited compared to the 100x opportunities out there and those 100x opportunities are likely to hold and grow if Bitcoin holds and grows then to me the crazy Bull Run logic is you want to be allocated in some way to these altcoins the zero Infinity bucket knowing that it goes to zero or the damn Moon and you're comfortable with the odds of it doing one or the other and you're ready for either outcome that's where I'm at again make your own decisions I have enough fiat currency I have enough cash in my world that if my crypto goes to zero I'll keep eating I'll keep surviving and my life won't be changed obviously it would suck ass but I would still continue to live and survive and pay rent a lot of people aren't in that same boat so you have to make the decisions based on your own Financial decisions I'm not going to be there to pay your rent or to feed your kids if you can't do it you got to take care of your own period okay so let's get to the fun stuff okay beam Merit Circle again they were called Merit Circle I covered them at about 40 cents and they've shot up here to what was the equivalent of $2 but when they did a 1 to 100 split on beam now the price is reflected you can think of this as 0.0043 or something like that so they've done about a 4.4x since I covered them absolutely smoking those gains and they are one of the most important coins in the crypto gaming space they have a ton of Investments they have a treasury of nearly $100 million they are actively invested in some of the best games in the space and they are now partnered with immutable X to bring some cool technology to the immutable X ZK evm speaking of immutable X they are also on this list as you know I an immutable X seed investor I'm a massive investor in beam and I have huge huge bags of both of these tokens and I am so happy to see them climbing the ranks with absolutely Reckless abandon here and I have no reason to doubt that they will continue to grow as gaming continues to grow my hope is that immutable X becomes the first gaming token to crack the top 10 in crypto market caps and just for some perspective here it's at $2.6 billion market cap the top 10 is 13 here so it would have to five or 6 x from here to overcome the Doge and to me that would have to do that you know against the market so this would take take a massive gaming run but I don't think it's insane I think it might happen here and if it does happen then that might mean that beam becomes a top 25 coin or something like that again understanding that crypto is about categories niches storylines and if one coin from a category makes it astronomically High the entire category will reprice under it so the higher immutable goes that creates a higher ceiling for the rest of the gaming ecosystem to flourish in so as a massive gaming bull I'm very excited that immutable X is continuing to crush on the way up and that to me paves the way it blazes a trail for all of gaming to repic under it so as you see a mutable X make this massive run know that it's bullish for all of gaming that's the facts Gala as we've said they are a publisher they have several games and they had a massive destructive run down from their all-time high their all-time high was like 70 cents they're currently at three here so on their way back up if they are to make it back up could do astronomical gains again their downside is about 60% % they haven't pumped too hard here as you can see these other ones have pumped much harder they're up much more significantly but about 2.1x since we called it here on the channel Ronin again similar to Gala they have some games far less games here like immutable has like hundreds of games that are coming to the immutable xchain but Ronin has axi Infinity which was the most successful crypto game of all time and they also have now pixels online which has 400,000 active users now the thing about the Ronin ecosystem is it caters largely they have a huge fill Lino player base and so there's a lot of emerging economy Dynamics going on there but it is a very interesting and totally unique way to approach gaming and again there's a lot of different approaches here I'm not playing gatekeeper I'm just saying here's all the pieces and as you can see Ronin has performed pretty well of about 3.4x since we covered on the channel and that has a lot I think to do with pixels online which is this game that has a ton of active users right now again very few games on Ronin there's a few games on Gala there's quite a few games that are connected with beam actually launching on it subnet as well as dozens and dozens of Investments by the Merit Circle Dow and then you have a mutable X which is kind of like the big daddy gaming coin which we hope hope breaks into the top 10 next we have cify as you know cify is a Launchpad these launchpads as the market gets super hot again if we are to get this Raging Bull Market launchpads will go bananas they will go absolutely crazy because they will give you early access to tokens before they hit the market and token launches in a bull market can go absolutely dummy High I'm talking 10 20 50 100x 200x and more in the peak heat of the bull market and so if you get into the launch pads you can actually buy allocations to these new projects sometimes just 500 bucks sometimes a few thousand doll but if things go 20x 50x and you instantly have those tokens you can flip and make 20K 50k sometimes even more in single days and that is the magic of launchpads but it only works during Peak bowl season so again cify is kind of the leading gaming Launchpad I have a ton of cify tokens I cover them first at 60 cents here and so you're looking at almost a 6X since I covered them again you are welcome team elot trades if you guys have been rocking with the channel here in 2023 you know this has been probably the best content streak I've ever been on and I only intend to keep pushing harder because getting bullish early in the cycle is lower risk whereas getting bullish at the ultimate Peak is the higher risk and I personally hope I can get the most amount of people excited about this Market at an early stage when most coins are probably going to do well as opposed to at the end of a cycle when most coins are set up to absolutely implode that is the best way to do it and I hope this content helps the maximum amount of people but again it's not a team sport here you all got to understand it is you and you alone out there in the crypto markets once you choose to buy some coins next we got Prime again this is one of the most legit trading card games here in the space you have a $119 2023 low and uh their their current value is almost 9 bucks these guys are backed by a16z they're super duper legit and in my opinion this could be one of the highest performing gaming tokens of the cycle I'm definitely a big fan of what they're doing here and I hope hope they continue to crush it as you can see their fully diluted valuation here is almost a billion so they only have you know small amount of their token circulating like less than 30% of their token circulating so it really is a tiny uh circulating Market market cap and there will be token emissions here something to consider but they are one of the most advanced ecosystems and they definitely deserve a slot in anyone's gaming portfolio once again my philosophy on gaming is that it will eventually create mainstream hits the industry will continue to have some of the most attention and excitement surrounding it and when anything succeeds in gaming the rest of the tokens will get a lot of love so that's why I'm hyperfocused on gaming because as a niche I'm convinced it's going to succeed and its success will mean that focusing and distributing my bets within that niche in my opinion are most likely to succeed next we have neotokyo now this is a project that is mine obviously there are three projects here that I have founded and I cannot comment on for that reason I cannot tell you how risky they are or talk about prices or anything like that as a Founder but what I can tell you is that neotokyo has almost certainly fulfilled its highest aspiration of becoming the crypto gaming Illuminati the networking Club where the power Brokers of crypto gaming come to intermingle to share knowledge to build to launch stuff and that's why tons of projects want to actually launch to the neotokyo holders in this case immutable immutable X has recently joined literally every gaming project here is a part of neotokyo almost and it is very much so the place to be if you are a power broker in crypto gaming community members have created all kinds of projects one Community member actually created a Launchpad again this is not owned or controlled in any way by neotokyo or me or Becker but like cify someone created a Launchpad so that citizens could get access to projects before they launch and projects often times choose to want to come to neotokyo because they want these holders these Diamond hands these power Brokers to be a part of their projects and that's why neotokyo has been so successful is it is an absolutely phenomenal experiment that has succeeded in every way of becoming the networking Club of web 3 gaming now imposters is the game of the superverse now I do want to be very clear the best advice I can give you is to go put the Bell notification on for superverse just like this make sure that it's turned on because superverse will be shedding its skin and revealing an entirely new phase of the project that is very much so the connecting fiber between everything that you see in front of you in the crypto gaming space there is no doubt that this community is the biggest and most powerful in the crypto gaming space I've been spreading the good word about crypto gaming since 2018 I don't want to ruin this reveal because we've been working really hard on it but all I can say is turn post notifications on on superverse and understand that as hard as you see me working on content as much as you see me getting ahead of these Trends in the industry year after year week after week month after month year after year cycle after cycle I'm putting far more effort orders of magnitude more into these projects and you'll soon see the fruits of those labors now to be clear imposters is currently an nft form and the studio behind Impostors has recently hired an absolute legend in the form of Rick Ellis I highly encourage you to watch this interview where Rick Ellis list the new head of imposters actually explains why he's so bullish on web 3 gaming and his plan to take imposters mainstream again these projects are my primary focus and if you believe in what I'm doing then all I ask you to do is turn your notifications on for those projects because there is a lot coming in 2024 that you cannot see and if I'm right about this crypto cycle being the one which crypto gaming breaks through to the mainstream well there's a whole lot in store for these projects that you can't even imagine next this is actually the first project that I'm going to put on here that's unreleased this is called terse and when it comes to unreleased projects I want to be completely clear the hype before the release is totally damaging to the project and you do not if you're not one of the early investors you do not want to be buying these projects right out of the gate almost all new token projects during the Bull Run come out at astronomical prices they tend to pump and dump and you want to kind of stay away from them until they dump like crazy but again that depends on when they come out and when the tokens release but I will for your understanding just put these on your radar and I'm not going to talk too much about them cuz I don't want to create any artificial hype about them but I just want you to know that these are projects that are coming next year that I think are ones you should be researching and understanding token launches are very very tumultuous and you should definitely be careful when you get into any new token and understand the 360 view R rever gonzilla ready games pixels online and I'll also add in Heroes of mavia here again these are all super highquality gaming projects I've invested into most of them not all of them and again I'll follow up with more information when the time is relevant but I'm making a 2024 video I want you guys to know what I'm thinking about for 2024 next we have shrapnel shrapnel is one of the hottest gaming tokens they have one of the sickest looking games they're competing in the Big Show which is firstperson Shooters they have their own subnet on Avalanche I certainly certainly hope that they succeed in their mission again any game succeeding is good for all of the games and I'm very hyped on what they're doing definitely part of my 20124 portfolio next big time again I never put calls on trapal big time so I just have na here but again big time and trapnel are two of the best looking games in the industry right now big time is one that is very interesting because if you're actually farming within the game you can play an MMO RPG and players are making up to six figures over the last few months farming their big time tokens it is something that probably won't last forever so if you're looking to spend some time and grind a game and maybe end up earning some crazy amounts of tokens I highly suggest you check out big time and of course we have cus again I've covered cus in depth they're adding a LaunchPad had they burnt a ton of their supply they have tons of games in their ecosystem and they are up almost 10 full X's since we covered them here on the channel absolutely Smokey no jokey gains here out of cus their goal is to focus on browser gameplay totally democratized no fancy chips required and they believe that the Casual gaming route is the way to onboard billions of users again everyone has their own strategy some games are going for immersive AAA like you're seeing with gonzilla like you're seeing with shrapnel like you're seeing with eluvium another one that's on my list for 2024 I don't know why it's not here some are going for more casual games like cus mobile games like maavia or wagi and then you also have more economic games like you saw out of axi Infiniti and you're seeing the same thing out of pixels online next I'm just going to be real this risk rating again the risk rating for all the ones in yellow is high that means you know you could have a 20 to 50x but you could see a 90% correction this is big big risk right the medium highs you're seeing maybe a 15x or an 80% correction medium you have a 75% correction and a 12x you just have to understand the risk scale here and again this is not very sciency I just literally pulled these numbers out again this is like astrology for men here embrace it we're just looking to the stars but we're hoping that we get something right I've caught a lot right over the years it doesn't mean that I have special powers okay I'm just a dude with a webcam and this bright light and a neon sign and a pudgy penguin toy okay speaking of the memes I told you I only have two meme positions that is Pepe and Bon and since I said that Bon has gone on such a ripper it's up 3.1 6X and rumor has it it's going to get listed on coinbase again this is proof that the salana ecosystem is absolutely on fire okay absolutely on fire heepe I still think is the Daner meme by so many orders of magnitudes hoping that the Frog gets its legs under it and has like a Dogecoin moment at some point in the future I don't know I could be wrong it's still up a bit here from where I called it only 37% not crazy here but it's up right it's up we don't turn our noses up at gains here not after a three-year bare Market we do not turn our noses up at gains even small gains now the other thing that is a strategy here and this is so degenerate this is seek medical help degenerate this is you need to see a doctor okay you need to see a doctor if you're doing this there's something wrong with you but if you do want this level of 100x 200x gains from buying literal abysmal meme coins then what you want to do is look for the alternate l1s like Avalanche like Cosmos ecosystem chains and you want to see when they create their leading meme coins if you're early to those you could maybe ride on a real rocket ride here and so that's the dgen next level stuff is buying meme coins that are not goated like Pepe and Bon those ones are so absurdly risky it's not even worth discussing here you really you really just need help you need help you need Jesus next we have the AI Niche and I'm telling you guys my main focus here is aosh I have my own validator on aosh so you can delegate to it it's called ELO trades new go ahead and delegate towards it I think AOS is doing something that almost nobody is they're allowing for subletting of GPU power again AI will continue to make massive news throughout this cycle every few months there's a new AI explosion of interest and excitement and drama that will continue driving crazy amounts of attention excitement and investment into AI cryptocoins that means that things like AOS which allow you to lease computing power which is the driver of AI right now compute power is what this is all about things like aosh will potentially become massive massive focuses going forward there's also a bit tensor that's kind of like the leading one I don't have a big bag of it because it literally doesn't know how to dip it's just been going absolutely bananas it literally will not dip but I do think that if cool apps start launching on top of benser the tow token that could be something to look for again aosh is something I've been holding for years I believe they'll continue to crush it and if I were to say so it's my favorite AI coin I don't have a ton of AI coins but I do believe Ai and gaming will be the driving narratives of this bull run onward if you're looking for a little something extra there's dexes like dydx okay I could see Americans getting frustrated not having access to Futures Trading because none of the exchanges let Americans on anymore so decentralized Futures like dydx could become interesting again it doesn't pump very hard but I think their new version of their protocol which shares fees is quite interesting for me the nft play besides obviously neotokyo and imposters the nft play that is most likely to pull a board ape this cycle is pudgy penguins and that's because lucanet the CEO is an absolute Beast I'm a friend of his and I think his vision is going to take him somewhere crazy so if there's a next nft that is pudgy Penguins you're looking at to me the only thing I see as a pfp project that could hit 100 eth plus I think pudgy Penguins would be that crazy one again they've traded as low as 4 eth this year they're up quite a bit but they just keep delivering and they recently previewed this pudgy World concept which to me screams that they're making a video game and that they will transition from being a consumer packaged Goods project to being a video game project which to me is giga bullish cuz gaming to me is the thing I believe in the most most next if we're talking about ways that you can enhance your 2024 portfolio you're going to want to look at rotations this is when certain ecosystems like salana Ava Cosmos whenever they get hot you'll see the coins within those ecosystems get hot again I don't know what those coins are I'm not bringing attention to any of them in specific but let's just say you didn't want to do gaming for some reason or you didn't want to do AI you wanted to play in specific ecosystems this is one way to do it I'll end here with finally two D5 plays one of which I was an early investor into called Prisma I personally think Prisma will have a really nice future again I'm an early investor I plan to hold those tokens for a significant amount of time and see how the project performs it's still pretty under the radar as well this is in the liquid staking token narrative where you can stake your stake eth and get additional yield on top very interesting project as well as Rune which allows you to do onchain swaps between things like ethereum and Bitcoin I think Rune is kind of in its own category so Prisma and Rune are the two that I like for defi if I was to pick a defi coin okay this Raw video file is now almost an hour and 10 minutes if you guys feel like I delivered a tremendous amount of value for this 2024 portfolio overview the way I've gone through and explained why I'm in each one of these coins the risk involved the upside the downside the left side the right side then smash that like button and make sure you subscribe with that Bell notification on I believe that this is going to be one of the most incredible Cycles we've ever seen but of course there is a risk it doesn't play out if it does however I'm confident that gaming will be the most transformative place to be and I'm excited to continue to show you the light throughout this journey if I missed your favorite token you know what to do leave me a comment in the comment section below if you enjoyed this video check out this one that I made just a few days ago which goes even into more detail on some alt coins that I love as always I'm elot trades and I'll see you very soon on the next episode",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed signals, with some optimism fueled by recent announcements and others warning of potential downturns. The altcoin market cap has seen fluctuations, and while there are hopes for an \"altseason,\" technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook for now[1]. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's announcement about a strategic crypto reserve has boosted prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano[3].\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin and Altcoins:** The speaker emphasizes the potential for significant gains in Bitcoin and altcoins, particularly during dips, as these are considered safer entry points. However, they also highlight the risk of substantial losses, emphasizing the need for a well-thought-out investment strategy[4].\n\n- **Layer One Ecosystems:** Solana, Avalanche, and Polygon are highlighted as promising layer one ecosystems. Solana is noted for its strong ecosystem growth, while Avalanche and Polygon are seen as competitors with potential for significant gains[4].\n\n- **Gaming and AI:** The gaming and AI sectors are identified as key narratives for the upcoming bull run. Projects like Immutable X, Beam, and AOS are mentioned as having significant potential[4].\n\n- **DeFi and Stocks:** Coinbase stock is recommended as a stable investment, while DeFi protocols like Injective and Celestia are noted for their strength and potential[4].\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Predictions:** There are speculative predictions about Bitcoin reaching $350,000 and altcoins experiencing dramatic gains if the market cycle continues favorably[4].\n\n- **Risk Warnings:** The speaker emphasizes that investing in crypto is highly risky, with potential losses ranging from 70% to 100%. They stress the importance of having a clear investment plan and understanding the risks involved[4].\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Investment Strategy:** Investors are advised to focus on buying during dips and selling during rallies. It's crucial to have a well-defined investment plan and to diversify portfolios to manage risk[4].\n\n- **Market Awareness:** Keeping up with market trends and being prepared for volatility is essential. Investors should be cautious of hype and ensure they understand the fundamentals of any project before investing[4].\n\n- **Risk Management:** The importance of risk management is highlighted, with the suggestion to allocate funds wisely and be prepared for potential losses[4].",

    "transcript": "guys what can we say terrible day in the markets absolutely horrible let's jump into what the experts are saying and what we should do with our portfolios or what is left with them let's have a look at ILO trades he says easily one of the worst months I've ever experienced in crypto miles deutcher says today has been a horrendous day for altcoins one of the worst I've seen in a long time tweeting out the crypto bubble Maps which we're going to get into in a second but so far and this is actually I mean as as I'm talking now the markets are still declining so we don't know how messy this is going to get by morning but at the moment over a188 billion US was wiped out from the crypto Market in the past 24 hours and if you go to coin market cap and you can see even something like ethereum down 20% xrp down 23% salana holding a Little Bit Stronger uh cardano down 31% we can also SW by biggest gainers fcoin seem and Hyper liquid seem to be the want and you always know when USD and usdc are trading at a premium that people are bearish and panic selling but even look at these worst performance guys you got something like Casper down 34% SPX surprising to see him leading the bleeding there's a rhyme but we're not in the we're not in the day for Rhymes this is the day for sorrow and sadness uh SPX at 70 cents at a $700 million market cap what else down here is falling flaky so a lot of meme coins Cosmos lay ones all falling have a look at the crypto bubbles something interesting about this if I go to the day here which actually is very similar to the week it's almost the exact same funny enough cuz basically everything's crashing today specifically there's no giant bubbles like normally you'll see like one or two really massive bubbles where you're like oh that's what's um leading the the negative Market but it's pretty even across the board and of course you can speculate what this was from you had the Deep seek uh thing going down they got the Trump tariffs going down and then you've got unemployment data coming out soon people speculating is not going to be as good as expected but you can see almost every bubble is equally down 20 to 30% which is a substantial amount of money if you're holding um the 100 Grand of altcoins you'll be down 30 40 Grand today depending on what you're holding this is the others chart which is everything about Bitcoin falling off a cliff going from 334 billion down to 244 billion and you can see just really breaks the shape of this entire graph which is pretty crazy great BTC tweets Morad went from $56 million to a humble $30 million in 2 weeks and has never sold a single token I respect the conviction you can see this is his mem coin portfolio mad still believes he's going to be the first memec coin billionaire we're going to get into that in a second and he's holding strong his $30 million of memecoins okay so that is the sadness that is what everyone is feeling out the way that's the shared empathy but now let's get into how people are playing this is this the real time that the altcoin season has been canceled and it's going to be Bitcoin dominant and no one else is going to make m I mean we already had some run-ups we're already up 3 45x from lows was that it well let's check in with these boys and see what they are saying because I personally do not think so I should give my thoughts at the end as well and why I think that and again I'm not an expert I follow what the experts do I've made a decent amount of money in crypto but I want to give you my thoughts because one people ask for it but two maybe it's going to help shape your thoughts uh based on my read of the market okay how crypto says is altcoin season cancelled the question that people are finally asking and in my mind I'm glad that they're finally asking for it because the Hall of January I'm like that can't be the ShakeOut that does not feel like a ShakeOut I've been through shakeouts before and people need to lose hope in order for it to be a ShakeOut if everyone's like oh yeah this is a little ShakeOut a little 10% down on the portfolio oh no it hurts because we've had up for the last 60 days I've been watching other influences I watched miles Deutscher I watched House of Krypto I watched Connor Kenny I watched miles DEA and I watched a couple of other influencers who even in their videos they said if that was the top and Miles dorer was talking about we did hit some 3 to five X's even if they're down now and it's this point when there's a little bit of doubt in even the top influencers mind that I'm personally like okay we're almost through the ShakeOut we're almost through because shakeouts aren't shakeouts if they're not believable they need most people to believe that we are crashing to zero ASA crypto said that the sentiment in January 2021 before an enormous altcoin season pumping is the exact same sentiment as right now and it could not be more obvious let's have a look at some of these TW tweets that he tweeted is a 225,000 views this really did take off uh from as you can see in the dates 2021 which I'll show you the graph in a second was before the market went crazy no allcoin season this time so dump the garbage while you still can it seems that there will be no alt season this year only Bitcoin strategic move and I agree no old season what if I told you there was no old season only seasonal alts this is what people are saying right now this is what they were saying way before token Skyrocket this is salana currently at 183 us dollar down to whopping 15% today which is a big pullback for a layer one like salana uh you can see it was sitting at this is December 2020 $150 $1.70 about $2 you know this is a 2X guys this is like people would kill for a 2X in today's market uh but it looks like it's a flatline and you can see if you got into salana say at $150 back in 2020 and it pumped up all the way to $8 like wow that's like a 5x return on your money and then goes all the way up again to almost more than a 10x return on your money turning a$1 Grand into a million do you'd think that's the pump but then what happens a ShakeOut so to speak or a pullback they're very natural you can see goes from $17 down to $13 which isn't crazy uh but you know that's a solid amount what is that 30% maybe a little bit more than 30% okay but then that goes Trend sidewards that's fine then you're like oh I'm glad I didn't sell on that 30 40% pullback because we are going up and you go all the way up to $27 so now you're up say at 20x then from $27 it pulls down another maybe 20% there tiny little dip skyrockets and it's now it's up at $50 now you're up what is that 305x on your money however what happens next boom is the market over you go from $53 salana down to $23 an insane pullback over a very short period of time something that's reminiscent of today if you fell for this ShakeOut and I'm not saying we're in the exact same position as this but I'm saying this is not a new position to be in if this is the shake out and if you did fall out there and sold you would miss the true bull runup again not instant not everything's instant you're going to be patient in this market of salana to $200 and to $250 like that have a look how small that run up there if you sold on this little dip here and that is what people are saying this final ShakeOut is right now John says all right finally back home Market's looking rough if you pray for rain you need to deal with mud this was a man that turned three grand into $2 million better days are coming we've been through this hundreds of times before this is the consoling thing here it's nothing new as we just saw this tweet by mad is how I'm personally going to be playing this and there's a reason why even if it's not true I think it's going to be an asymmetric bet to play it like this Morad says in Bull markets and especially in year four of bull markets that's where we're in guys we're in the final up swing followed by a down swing historically Ultra optimists win Ultra optimists even when it's really hard to be optimistic they're the people who are going to come away with the Ferraris and Lambos the yachts and everything you could heart could ever dream of join and find the communities with true Spirit of optimism no matter what they will outwork and outperform everyone and this is honestly how I'm personally playing it because let's just say worst case scenario and I'm glad I'm saying this because this is what other influencers were saying too as soon as they recognize this that might have been it let's just say it was it okay cool that's not what I'm playing for I didn't come here for a three to a five to a 7x I came here for the 100 X and if I have to wait another 3 to 4 years for that 100x well then that's fine I'll wait for another 3 to 4 years but I don't want to be like oh my God I should have sold for that 5x that's crazy I want generational wealth and therefore in a pullback like this if I play Ultra optimistically and I'm betting that this Market is going to then continue to go to 10 to 50 to 100 x as long as you know which tokens to invest in well then the asymmetric bet is for me to move a large amount of money from Fiat which I've kept on the sideline into crypto because again if I lose it or it Hobs that's the game I play but there's the chance and in my head the 90% plus chance that this is going to go 50 to 100x especially in mad's mem coins they're the ones I'm going to be looking at and what makes me even more confident in this well look who's selling look who's scared versus look who's accumulating and buying retail is scared and selling the norm is the mainstream large investors are actually accumulating have a look down here this is Bitcoin the retail is in the purple everyone's selling off and fing the market and the large investors in the pink going up they're the ones actually getting more and more crypto merigan the trader said this is the biggest bear trap of the cycle it happened in 2017 it happened in 21 it happened in 25 every major Bull Run had a final bear trap before sending it and this is starting to feel like I would suspect that we still probably have a little bit more pullback to go but it's starting to feel like people actually panicking people actually thinking this m not go higher which is a sign of a legitimate bear trap it's also the sign of it crashing to zero but again asymmetric bat at least for me you're either going to get shaken out or position for the biggest move yet it's your choice again tweeting that Scotty pipp and graph and I got another Scotty pipp and graph that he tweeted today coming up for you uh Mr crypto says old season has always started in February have a look in 2017 the alts started taking off in February in 2021 SS went parabolic in February and look at this pullback guys remember in Jan second was when they said there's no there's going to be no old season you can see that's this massive pullback that they saw back in 2021 before parabolic it's going to be obvious in hindsight if it plays out this exact same way and goes parabolic ilio says painful as 2025 has been so far we're living through the most insane times in financial history agreed making the right few moves this year is going to absolutely print money and the Right Moves at least for me personally is going against what feels right in the moment 60 chests for all the marbles not time to log off it's time to lock in 2 x Scotty Pippen have a look at this a little bit of a humor here don't get shaken out because this happens in the blink of an eye markets can move fast have conviction build with Community stay focused and keep learning I agree emphasis on keep learning and he's tweeted this graph that's gone absolutely parabolic out of nowhere which I thought was kind of funny Alex Bea says the bull case for crypto this year is still outrageous the bull case for memes is taking a break which is interesting because I follow Morad and I follow Becca and mad thinks that this is the time to be loading up on Meme coins on sale and Becca thinks all this month and then some is about to roll back into a more traditional Bull Run of eth and utility tokens SPX 6900 eth said when mop mad can hold millions of draw down you can too s SPX will hit $5 billion in February and double from every month onwards and then Giga is also holding up relatively strong compared to a lot of other tokens you can see popcat down to 200 mil after touching two bill down 90% which is crazy chill guy obviously has been falling off a cliff um at the time of this tweet G Chad was at $417 million but it hasn't had that extra fall off a cliff down like all these other memes have at the moment it's sitting right on a 400 mil market cap it did touch I think a 330 which this is one I'm trying to get into and I've been waiting for a pullback into 300 so I will be buying some giga the other one I do want to pick up of course is mad's top token uh the SPX 6900 which has fallen way down into the $600 million market cap level which is as you can see hasn't been done since way back here at the end of December which actually not that long ago I thought it was going to be longer than that uh but you can see massive retracements now the last thing I'll leave you with if you're getting shaken out and you're done totally fine everyone's going to play their own game if you're playing a similar game to me and you think that this could be the final ShakeOut before we go parabolic before we go the 50 to 100 X's that we've all dreamed of the one piece of advice I have from being in crypto for about four or five years now is don't think it's going to happen overnight and don't think you're going to time the absolute bottom if if I buy in here at 73 cents and it's going to pull all the way back to 48 cents uh I'm going to be like oh I definitely shouldn't have bought in well if I fast forward that 6 to 10 months or even 2 to 3 months or 2 to three weeks in some circumstances uh this could be back up at $250 and it' be like it doesn't matter if I bought in at 50 cents or 70 cents don't try and time the absolute bottom don't try and rush it in my personal opinion also do if you think it's going to pay off but for me I'm going to be dollar cost averaging over the next week or so and trying to average the bottom number here cuz I'm betting that that SPX is going to hit that 100 billion even the $50 billion mck cap which gives me a nice 40 45x from here well I don't really care if it's going to be perfectly timed on the bottom let me know your thoughts is this the final ShakeOut or is this the end of the 2025 bull market let me know on the comments below thanks for watching stay safe see you in the next video",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano facing substantial declines. This downturn follows a brief surge triggered by Donald Trump's announcement about a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. However, the market sentiment quickly turned bearish due to Trump's new tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, which heightened economic uncertainty and led to a global sell-off in risky assets[1][2][3].\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin and Major Altcoins:** Bitcoin has dropped nearly 10%, while Ethereum fell by over 11%, XRP by around 12%, and Solana by more than 15%. Cardano experienced the largest decline, plummeting by about 20%[1][2].\n- **Market Sentiment:** The overall crypto market cap has decreased by over 10%, reflecting a shift towards risk aversion among investors[1][3].\n- **Stock Market Impact:** The downturn in cryptocurrencies coincides with a decline in U.S. equities, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones also experiencing losses[1].\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Altcoin Season Speculation:** Some analysts speculate that the current downturn might signal the end of an altcoin season, with Bitcoin potentially becoming more dominant[2].\n- **Risk of Further Declines:** The imposition of tariffs and ongoing economic uncertainty could lead to further volatility in the crypto market[3][4].\n- **Potential for a Bull Run:** Optimistic investors believe that the current pullback could be a precursor to a significant bull run, similar to past market cycles[2].\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Diversification and Caution:** Investors are advised to be cautious and consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with market volatility.\n- **Long-Term Strategy:** Some experts suggest adopting a long-term perspective, focusing on potential future growth rather than short-term fluctuations.\n- **Dollar Cost Averaging:** Investors might consider dollar cost averaging as a strategy to reduce the impact of market volatility on their investments.\n\n## Cryptocurrencies Mentioned\n\n- **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n- **Ethereum (ETH)**\n- **XRP**\n- **Solana (SOL)**\n- **Cardano (ADA)**\n- **Binance Coin (BNB)**\n- **USD Coin (USDC)**\n- **Tether (USDT)**\n- **Casper**\n- **SPX**\n- **Giga**\n- **Popcat**\n- **G Chad**\n\n## Investment Recommendations\n\n- **Ultra Optimism:** Some investors advocate for maintaining an ultra-optimistic stance, focusing on long-term growth potential despite current market conditions.\n- **Meme Coins:** There is interest in accumulating meme coins during pullbacks, with the belief that they could offer significant returns in future bull runs.",

    "transcript": "on this channel we break down the top crypto influencers in the world and we copy trade them and we figure out what their heuristics and thesises are in order to get the same results in the market that they get right now in the market things are looking a little bit dicey let's have a look at this probably the biggest YouTube crypto influencer says he's lost $1 million Us in crypto I believe this is in a date it says just another day in crypto but he personally we're going to get to the good news during the Middle the the probably a about a third of the way through this video it's going to turn around and talk to you about how this is just the Classic pullback in crypto and the super cycle is still on but no spoilers there Brian Jung says expecting a bounce within the next 5 to 10 days crypto go John says deleted my portfolio tracker I'll redownload it in the next few weeks saying don't refresh your portfolios again cool to have a little bit of a idea on what John thinks the time frame is going to be for the turnaround and the actual super cycle taking place where things get exponential and make things look really silly the allcoin daily says hey boss did you miss me and tweeted out the classic going from Ferraris and talking about moving to Dubai with the boys to back to McDonald's for your $8 an hour whatever hell they pay these days anom says just check my mem coin bags and posted the classic photo the classic meme of bit boy Ben taking his Asma puffer during the fight with anom now have a look at the Bitcoin chart but I'm going to put my own personal thesis based on what I am thinking is going to happen here but to be honest this is nothing guys look at the look at the pullback on bitcoin so it it topped at 108 a little bit higher than this is actually saying I think this has got it at about 99 pull back to 93 Grand this is uh a tiny little blip when you zoom out on the Bitcoin chart and even I'm like oh I'm going to start this YouTube video with crypto bubbles where you've got all the red Bubbles and create some fear and panic and then pull it back and saying it's going to be okay and we're all going to be wealth we're not all going to be wealth it 5% of us are going to be ex extremely wealthy as the super cycle hits but this is the week on Crypt Bubbles and honestly these altcoins don't look too bad at all now this is the top 100 so I clicked up here I'm like okay maybe we'll show down in the real degenerate alts and how far they're down but have a look in this week the top 100 to 200 coins are only down uh 9% um the top 500 coins are barely down the top 900 to 1,000 coins is the worst and it's only down 13% so some St to think we could be pulling back way more than this and still look extremely bullish for the year now crypto KN puts this this is where we turn the video into the positive right here he says imagine being told back in October when Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 that just months later the fear and greed index would hit 50 again which is a neutral Index this is how greedy or fearful people are feeling in the in the crypto market and Bitcoin would be at $93,000 it would sound insane to people and art school reject who is one of the meme coiners that we broke down on this channel says cutting through the fat here this looks like a very picturesque local bottom Silk Road is fuding again that's that $6.5 billion US that the US is holding and apparently Biden is threatening to sell it before Trump gets into office which just like when Germany was selling their billions of dollars of crypto it just needs to be absorbed before we go parabolic mem coins to zero bears are out people yelling that mem coins are going to go to zero and that there's no utility to them the classic mid Cur is and Bitcoin back down to 50K callers are also out meanwhile the first pro crypto president we've ever had in the USA gets inaugurated in just a few days I believe that's about 10 days away from now ILO trades seconds that and says the first crypto president in history takes office this month good luck to the sellers if you're selling now you better need the money this is not what Elia says this what I'm adding on top of just so we can get clear with that because for me I'm not selling a thing up down maybe I don't know I also have check my portfolio but I'm guessing about six figures but these are the bumps that we need to ride if we want the generational wealth if you are paper handing here or you're investing money that you can't afford to lose these are the nice small lessons that we're getting along the way because maybe that's the whole point of crypto the teaches the life lessons we need to learn Johnny says in my opinion this is one gigantic ShakeOut before Trump gets into office a month from now it will be so obvious and we will be patting each other in the back and being nice to each other once again it's funny as you're watching miles Deutsch's YouTube video um in preparation for this video see what he was talking about cuz he's really good on the macroeconomic factors and it's crazy how quickly his YouTube comments have turned everyone's gone from like oh miles is our hero to oh my God flip flopper miles I'm like wow it's crazy to see the emotions and the sentiment all across crypto change so rapidly from just Zero to Hero is already hero whether we're talking about Bitcoin or an altcoin or an influencer if you cannot get emotional and you can see the bigger patterns you're going to be taking money from everyone who is out there and complaining KL chassis thinks that we are in this point right here just before we go exponential and reach our Euphoria which is where we want to try and time the market to get out somewhere along this top uh double Peak here but he thinks this is the be trap a little bit of a pullback a little bit of consolidation before we go exponential and if kyl chassis doesn't know well enough how about Scotti Pippen because he says they want your Bitcoin they want your crypto don't get shaken out he also thinks we are in that point of the bull trap now this was the most uh convincing slide in this entire presentation it's not really a slide or a presentation it's a tweet in a video but the Bitcoin historian says reminder Bitcoin is always boring before it goes parabolic it likes to really shake people out with sideways action when it's going down a lot of people might be like oh it's good opportunities to buy put more money in but when it go sideways it really bores people and you can see every single Bitcoin cycle from 2011 to from 2013 to to 2017 to 2021 now 2025 before we've gone parabolic before we've seen all and most the gains Bitcoin has trended sideways and had that pullback before we took off and let's jump down to R pal who talks about the banana Zone which is that really upwards and to the right part of the graph that we were just looking at says yes we are still in the banana Zone banana Zone Phase 1 was the breakout last year now the consolidation like the 2016 2017 consolid after phase one this will not last long next up banana Zone Phase 2 the banana Singularity which is old season when everything goes up followed by a bigger consolidation consolidation is the graph going back down and accumulating going sideways and finally banana Zone phase 3 where the core winners explode onto make much higher highs the concentration phase this is my road map to Valhalla let's see the Michael sailor parody account this is not actually Michael sailor basically said the same how we're going to go sideways before every single up candle it's not going to be up only and let me put a little bit more of my personal thoughts in here I'm seeing people inside of our telegram I'm seeing people inside of other people's communities I'm seeing people on Twitter they're getting hungrier and hungrier for the gains because we've had some 10x gains some 12x gains some 50x gains and they've been really awesome mostly in the AI and meme space but people hear about uh their friends getting those gains they see other people on YouTube getting their gains and they want that for thems and they really start making short-term plays in order to say they got that 10 20 50 x really quickly when in reality these things play out over weeks and you might miss a couple of pumps that might Pump 10 20 x in a day but the pumps are getting quicker and quicker because people are getting hungrier and hungrier for them and all the liquidity is flowing into way more projects horizontally than being concentrated in the one or two that like say Alex Becka got into or Krypto God John got into now everyone is thinking that every influencer call is going to do the same thing and they're following these crazy influencers or they're following people who aren't even influencers or just in a Discord group with them recommending tokens that they're going to be rug pulled on them anyway so people need to take a quick breath through their nose calm down a little bit because gains are here to be made but not if you're rushing for them and not if you're uneducated I know that's a terrible uh advice to hear if you are uneducated and rushing for them because that's the last thing you want to hear also go play the casino you could also do really well if that's your strategy for me I think I'm going to do way better longterm by playing the long-term games now this Smiley Capital had a really good breakdown on why he thinks this is definitely not the top because he says the top last time no one was talking that this is the cycle top now everyone's calling is this the cycle top also no one was looking at any macro issues they were completely ignoring them ether trading at multiples above previous highs and the flippening which means eth being worth more than Bitcoin is thrown around a lot that's when you know you're getting to some absurd valuation and of course crypto is over mainstream media commercials and sponsor ships which I think that is happening a little bit I personally do not think we are anywhere near the top of the market at all uh but at least these top three if people are talking that this is the top it's most likely not the top in comparison to now everyone's talking about the top eth didn't even break all-time high yet participants expecting never- ending downtrend versus Bitcoin which is the opposite to the flipping they think Bitcoin is going to get stronger than eth apart from some obscure series named squid game which is a trash show apparently I know a lot of people love squid game occasional Zoomers gambling on fcoin and occasional Millennials calling HB xrp the future of Finance crickets it's not really hitting the mainstream crazies yet just stay bullish it's not that hard I'm tired of lending conviction since q1 2023 it's been 2 years guys and I'm still have to slap sense into most of you at $20,000 and now at $90,000 crashes clay tweeted this which I thought was really cool this was the eth graph and you can see it pulled down pulled down again had the runup which is what he's saying that we just had that nice little runup had a nice pullback consolidation before it went exponential and skyrocketed which means this could be if you believe that this is the super cycle a buying opportunity John says it's crazy that the market is giving us the best buying opportunity of 2025 in the first few weeks crash says in downturns people will sell the coins they don't believe in as much first hence why Bret continues to gain dominance over whiff and so many other the memes people don't want to sell their Brett first so therefore Brett even though they're both going down is going down less quickly than whiff and you can see which memes are holding the strongest and therefore which memes are likely to explode when the market comes back around crash says study what gains dominance in downturn Silvera says the same thing zoom out top meme coins will recover but SP SPX will explode hard it was I think the only token in the top thousand or top 500 or so that was green on yesterday and everything else was red and you can see if that's bullish wow farco down 44% in the time that SP SPX is up 5% you can see which ones the true Cults are the true convictions are and the long-term holds are when markets pull back marad said the same thing distance from alltime high for memec coins pay attention to the coins standing the strongest when Bitcoin dips they're the coins that will go ballistic and make us all really rich and wealthy in 2025 you can see distance from alltime high here Giga actually is pulled back the lease which I'm sad for but it's kind of interesting too cuz I'm sad that Giga hasn't pulled back to 300 mil market cap so I can get a large amount of money in but then if it had pulled back someone like Mard is going to be less bullish on it because it didn't hold its price as well so sort of a lose lose situation for someone like me but marad is saying get into Giga get into SPX get into these coins even if they haven't pulled back and I made a video yesterday about putting 100 Grand across about three or four of these tokens so go watch that if you haven't already because for me personally not Financial advice I believe this is a awesome buying opportunity now this is where I'm going to put my own opinion in here because this is a chart that Michael sailor made me aware of and Michael sailor is the most longterm player in all of crypto he's playing in decades and then you have people in telegram groups who was playing in minutes and it's a spectrum between then Becca plays within about a year maybe 6 months to 12 months and then you have the AI influencers at the moment who are even playing within 1 month trying to get that pump and then trying to get out but Michael sailor looks at bitcoin price over decades and when you zoom out it's one of the least volatile most steady upwardly compounding assets that you've ever seen it's the best performing asset in history and you can only see that when you zoom out so these a yearly candle since 2010 and you can see the entire 2017 Bull Run was this one candle here you can see the entire 2020 20 21 Bull Run were these two candles right here where are the red candles there's not that many red candles this a very volatile candle back in 2014 but you can see in the last 1 two 3 four 5 6 7even eight years you've had two red candles apart from that Bitcoin has gone up so think long term we've got the first ever Bitcoin president going into office in the US you've got the M2 money supply going up and Bitcoin a as liquidity sponge and why am I talking about Bitcoin when we're mostly an altcoin trading Channel well because everything follows the music of Bitcoin if Bitcoin can climb to 250k if you can climb to 150k if you can keep going up and to the right like it's done for the last 15 16 years we are going to be able to get that liquidity to trickle down into the meme coins into the altcoins into the AI agents have a lot of fun some of us are going to be able to cash out in profit and roll them back into the real long-term assets like Bitcoin and do extremely well if you're the type of person who thinks that this is the end of the market that's totally okay too it's very possible that you're right but what are you still doing here watching YouTube videos go move on to whatever the next Hot Topic is go build an AI company and whatever it is that we all decide to focus on let's stay educated keep building and keep working hard because that's how we make Monumental wealth over the next decade or so and it doesn't have to be crunched into a day thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility, with recent downturns attributed to macroeconomic factors such as the US-China trade tensions and regulatory uncertainties. Despite these challenges, many influencers and analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies, particularly with the advent of pro-crypto policies and technological advancements.\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin (BTC):** Despite recent price fluctuations, some analysts predict substantial growth, with Arthur Hayes suggesting a potential price of $1 million by the end of Trump's term, driven by devaluation of the dollar and increased liquidity[3]. However, short-term volatility is expected, with potential dips to $70,000[3].\n\n- **Ethereum (ETH):** ETH is currently trading at around $2,045, with predictions ranging from $1,200 to $15,000. Its strong DeFi presence and potential regulatory approvals could drive growth[2].\n\n- **Altcoins and Meme Coins:** Coins like Shiba Inu, FloppyPepe, and Pepe are highlighted for their potential to surge significantly, though they carry high risk[4]. Meme coins are seen as volatile but potentially lucrative, with some influencers suggesting they could explode in value during market recoveries.\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Predictions:**\n  - **Bitcoin:** Potential for $1 million by the end of Trump's term[3].\n  - **Ethereum:** Ranges from $1,200 to $15,000[2].\n  - **Meme Coins:** Potential for significant growth, though highly speculative[4].\n\n- **Risks:**\n  - **Regulatory Uncertainty:** SEC actions and regulatory changes can significantly impact crypto prices[2].\n  - **Market Volatility:** Recent sell-offs and macroeconomic pressures pose risks to investors[1][3].\n  - **Liquidity Crisis:** Concerns about an impending liquidity crisis could affect crypto prices[3].\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Long-Term Strategy:** Many experts recommend a long-term approach, focusing on established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while being cautious with speculative altcoins[2][3].\n\n- **Risk Management:** Investors are advised to manage risk by diversifying portfolios and not investing more than they can afford to lose[2].\n\n- **Education and Patience:** The importance of staying informed and patient is emphasized, as short-term gains can be misleading and volatile[2][3].",

    "transcript": "Bitcoin has just made its first higher high literally moments ago for the first time in over 6 months here in cryptoland it's been 84 years and that signals that the next leg of this historic Bitcoin Bull Run is about to begin so today I'm going to be giving you all of my most valuable coins a snapshot of my entire portfolio if I were to rebuild it today so it is a bit Consolidated for my portfolio that I revealed almost a year ago back in Q3 and Q4 of 2023 that's right I'm going to give you my highest conviction bets the things that I am very confident will print astronomical upside in the event that Bitcoin does what we're here to see it do which is take us to that hallowed land of 100K and Beyond during this time altcoins will 10 20 30 and some will even 50 and 100x and we're here to bring you the absolute gems of all gems so destroy that like button hit that sub button if you're new around here and let's get our hands dirty with our favorite topic which is alt coins that can retire our Bloodlines within just a few months wait don't you go one step further that's right your eyes do not deceive you in fact I can hardly believe what I'm seeing that's Bitcoin dipping ever so slightly under 65k but the Bears are weak this dip it might be your last chance and of course the market wanted to dip right before I put my video out so this here is a warning the next time you see me it's Mustachio time the last time I had this mustache was Q4 2021 you remember that time a good time it's time to bring those good times back now of course anything could happen we don't know what's going to happen I put all my chips on red here and if you're going to join me smash that like button let's get to the video Mustachio is here the Bull Run is back and this little Dippy Dipper roon might be your last chance now as you can see here Bitcoin is just peeking above this yellow line or this orange line which is 65k and that was the Line in the Sand that we were looking to see crossed if we zoom out here you can see we've had lower highs all the way since the beginning of March earlier this year we've had lower lows lower lows and then we had this beauty right here which will change to a different color so you can understand this changed everything and once we put in this higher low here and this was back on the 6th of September we needed to come and make a higher high over this level which was exactly 65k we've now managed to do that we've traded Above This lower high we've put in a higher low and now a higher high and so finally for the first time and with feels like forever we are now in a macr trend change a higher time frame change from bearish to bullish here on Bitcoin now of course a few things here bitcoin's crazy it could do anything nothing is guaranteed I'm not promising you riches on a plate I'm telling you that I've believed that this risk was worth taking not just for the last few months but for the last few years since March of 2023 I have not put out a bearish piece of content no sir no ma'am I have kept the messaging straight up and consistent because I believe that's what the audience needs so if you guys appreciate the consistency no flip-flopping just straight bull mode for the last year and a half once I saw liquidity being injected by the FED then you know what to do smash that like button and let's get to the good stuff cuz we're about to show you why Bitcoin is super bullish and I'm going to show you the portfolio that I think destroys all others here so yes you can detect my enthusiasm I'm excited as hell I've been waiting for this for what feels like forever first off some charts here we have crypto total market cap obviously breaking the structure we have the same uh sort of lower lows and lower highs here and we can see here higher low and then officially we got a higher high here so the same exact structure we're seeing on crypto total market cap which is all the coins not just Bitcoin and in my opinion even more important we have others now others is essentially every coin that is not in the top 10 I believe it's the coins outside of the top 10 so these are the real altcoins where you're going to see if these things are starting to move that's a sign that altcoins are really getting ready and as you can see not as crisp of a diagonal but you can see it was lower highs all the way here until we got the bottoming a higher low a higher low and then finally now a higher high so others once again is getting ready to make a move and this is where the true insane juice comes to the altcoins where you get the 10 20s 30 XS is when others starts to make a monstrous move here to New Highs but there are several fundamentals here that are happening around the crypto industry that are so bullish and in timing with the best time of the year now if you didn't know this Q4 is almost always insanely bullish with the election years in specific being some of the most bullish of all q4s so if seasonality and history repeats themselves and you know history loves to rhyme here in cryptand we should be looking at a great next few months especially October here as I believed there's going to be a lot of pre-election hype here and again we'll talk about how I plan to game the election season not on this video but on a subsequent video leave me a comment if you're excited for that one but I wanted to talk about something massive that just changed with Bitcoin and this is that we just got Bitcoin options approved that phrase probably means almost nothing to you but I'm going to explain why it's actually something really significant and why it could act as even more significant Rocket Fuel to this whole Bitcoin bull run something that we've been missing to draw in astronomical new sums of money from trafi you know the traditional Finance World thrives on Leverage and it thrives on derivatives if you didn't know this the derivatives Market is wildly bigger astronomically bigger than the actual equities and commodities markets derivatives essentially people betting with leverage on the directional value of these underlying assets are worth up to a 100 times more than the underlying assets themselves in short Wall Street loves to bet with leverage on these assets and they love it a whole lot more than actually holding the underlying assets so up to this point yes the Bitcoin ETF has been amazing but with ETF options which are derivative products we're going to see a whole another level of Finance Bros getting their hands kneee in the crypto Waters if the ETF was snorkeling this is some deep sea scuba diving stuff this is some Next Level stuff and I'm about to explain how this works so I'm going to explain this in like NFL terms because I don't want to get too deep in here because there's a lot of very technical terms here but for the first time you have to understand that bitcoin's notional value will be fractionally banked meaning that there will be assets traded against Bitcoin that are not just whole Bitcoins trading on the ETF right now when you buy Bitcoin on the ETF whatever you buy is actually getting bought by the ETF it's a on toone relationship this is going to be fractionally banked and a lot of people worried that this could create a phenomenon of paper Bitcoin where there's a lot of fake IUS for Bitcoin out there but not actual physical Bitcoin backing this up however the magic SAU here is that options allow for people to bet with a small amount of money and have a potential massive outcome they can bet for example $100 and bet with size of ,000 or even up to $10,000 and one of the big things about these options is they now have long-dated options so instead of getting very short-term price fluctuations you can now bet on the price of Bitcoin in say the end of 2025 or seasonally important dates and those are options that I can see being insanely popular with trafi these new products are going to appeal to the biggest money bags in a way that they can get fully d gen with Bitcoin in massive size believe it or not the most sophisticated investors don't just buy things like Apple stock they buy derivatives of Apple stock they buy exotic products that can turn their base hits into home runs to give you a sports term here but normally these products would act to actually limit the volatility meaning there would be less upside and less downside with options like this on traditional products like apple and that's because if Apple goes crazy up in price Apple as a company can actually issue more shares they can dilute the stock we saw this with GameStop in gme when the stock was pumping like crazy they just issued a bunch of more shares so that they could actually just sell and dump effectively new Supply on the Wall Street bets crowd and that effectively killed the bull run and the company ended up with a gargantuan amount of cash you can't do that with Bitcoin because there is no more Supply to issue so you can't dilute it as it goes up now the most important thing I think here is this part which is that Bitcoin has unique volatility characteristics one of the most important is the volatility smile and that means that as the price goes up the volatility actually increases now most assets as the price goes up like apple Google whatever the actual change in price day byday percentage wise usually drops there's less volatility as the price goes up and this means that there's less risk in holding that asset whereas Bitcoin as it starts to go on its rampaging bull runs it can have explosive up and down moves that are absolutely wild and it typically goes up in volatility as the price goes up and this makes it a very unique asset historically with call options as spot Rises meaning the price Rises implied volatility tends to fall so while the option Delta increases ignore all that the rate of increase slows however with Bitcoin as the price goes up the people selling these options will probably need to buy more Bitcoin to cover those options but because of bitcoin's unique volatility profile meaning it can continue to have insane volatility even more volatility as the price goes up well those dealers selling these options if the price pumps up will need to buy a ton of Bitcoin to control their risk cuz if they're selling options that could pay out the buyer an astronomical sum the way that they're going to cover their butts is by owning a bunch of Bitcoin so that they participate in that upside and that way if Bitcoin keeps exploding well they have the underlying Bitcoin to cover themselves so this means if Bitcoin pops up in an aggressive way any options dealer will have to buy a bunch of Bitcoin meaning each price explosion will lead to a ton more Bitcoin buying of the underlying which again leads to more price explosion so unlike something like apple where a price EXP expon could lead to the asset getting more boring this price explosion the way these options will work and the way Bitcoin Works will most likely lead to bitcoin getting way crazier so the approval of these options is going to be crazy and it's actually going to add rocket fuel in a way that will bring in all kinds of new speculators into this asset it could be that next SpaceX booster on the Bitcoin rocket ship this is huge and it comes exactly on the day that we hear China is about to go all out on their own stimulus to save the private economy China is pulling out all the stops to boost stock prices and to stimulate their economy and this comes just days after the US Federal Reserve announced their 50 basis point cut that's right while there is still risk that the United States could fall into a recession and this could be bad for our bags all signs right now are showing that the global economy is looking to ease conditions and drive more liquidity into the stock market into the investment sector unless we get some wild recession here this is going to be absolutely crazy for our bags just to be clear on the China thing I think Lyn Alden has a great take here base cases that China stimulus is less impactful than the Bulls think initially but more persistent than the Bears think as some have pointed out the numbers aren't actually huge instead it's more about a change of priorities upon having reached certain pain points again when you change monetary policy it's not a single action but it's an overall momentum shift and it's an ideological shift that shows Global central banks are starting to add liquidity to markets to prop up economies cuz they believe that there is a risk in not doing so which means that we should look forward to not just a single action but a series of actions and an overall mindset of supporting assets like Bitcoin and other risk assets and driving money the trillions of dollars that are currently on the sidelines sitting in t- bills and money market funds those are going to come storming into risk assets and should lift both traditional markets and especially crypto to astronomical new highs this is not a drill this is the year of the having in Q4 this is the beginning of what is historically the most bullish time and we're getting all kinds of signs from Global central banks from every single Corner that we are not alone we are fighting this battle in tandem with the biggest Financial players the central banks around the world and look while I have not been a fan of the democratic approach to cryptocurrency certainly why would you it's been super aggressive and hostile Kamala Harris apparently is saying that she wants the US to remain dominant in blockchain I personally don't believe her I think she's in this say anything to get elected part of the campaign and it seems like she might not be super confident right now again you could say the same thing about Donald Trump but he has been much more consistent in supporting the crypto movement either way if both candidates want to come out and support crypto then great that removes some of the election risk that we might get hostile leadership back in the white house again I know everyone feels extremely passionately about this election but my passion for crypto is so much bigger than any of this drama if we can wipe away that layer of uncertainty to me it would just be amazing for the industry nothing to see here just gold making new all-time highs here around $2,700 per ounce that is a record and you know gold obviously is the canary for when things are going to shift and when there's a fear of inflation and and essentially Bitcoin being digital gold you can think of Gold's move upwards as incredibly bullish for Bitcoin and what's crazy here is looking at the Block raay tweet he said what if they did this to us again where you essentially had 2023 where it was so boring from essentially March all the way through the end of the year through October and we're having the exact same thing he said what if this happened again said it's crazy they did this to us I think it's crazy as well but honestly shout out to everyone who's Still rocking with the channel if you're still here you deserve what's coming next if you were buying aggressively during these boring periods under 60k I think that fate will treat you very very very wisely and obviously a lot of altcoins are already up 50 100% or more off their lows and so if you were buying under 60k under 55k then you were taking that risk and you deserve whatever reward is coming your way all right it's time now to segue into talking about my new approach to my portfolio so first I'm going to give you a an overview here I've simplified things especially if you're new on the channel this is going to be the way that I'm approaching my entire crypto portfolio and no I haven't sold any of my early investment bags I haven't sold any of my angel Investments which are largely unlocking little by little over time I want a lot of those to move before I sell them and I think that a bull market will treat them well but for now if I was starting over from scratch I would do this I would have 60% of my coins in my high conviction bucket and 40% in what I call zero Infinity where the high conviction bucket makes up the stuff that you know is going to be a part of this bull run and it's going to have limited downside compared to the zero Infinity bucket and the zero Infinity bucket is as it sounds it's either going to zero or it's going to infin and those are the odds we like in crypto cuz if you get a few Infinities mixed in there it dramatically changes your whole portfolio performance so my high con conviction bucket quite simply is Bitcoin ethereum salana and coinbase stock there it is that's your high conviction bucket I I know those coins are going to print obviously I've added telegram ton Network sort of in there on the side because it's been so wildly successful but again it's not a cheap coin and if you were to take it in a very simple way this is my high conviction bucket these are the percentages I started with last year I honestly would put a salon equal to ethereum here cuz in a lot of ways salana and ethereum are competing for the same heads space the same mind share and coinbase stock is just essentially the Trad five play on crypto this is my high conviction bucket any way that you mix this up if you like one more than the other feel free to play with this I don't think there's any wrong configuration here you want a little bit of all these in my opinion that's how I'm approaching it and then the zero Infinity bucket these are my narratives I told you guys since the beginning gaming AI in memes I made that clear in the middle of 2023 and if you guys appreciate me calling that effectively these have been the standout categories since middle of 2023 gaming had the biggest wave in Q4 of 2023 and then we had the AI and meme wave these have been the standout categories obviously gaming has had a pretty significant reset but not all the coins especially some of the ones closest and nearest and dearest to my heart have actually had as bad of a reset as the rest of gaming in fact some of the star performers have significantly outperformed almost any other utility coin that was pre-existing the cycle the other categories here are rwa I mean this is a black rock play to me RW are problematic but if Black Rock literally loses it and goes full on into rwas it's going to create a narrative right that's just the reality so rwa I'll be coming out with a video on that and then of course layer ones there's always going to be room for some layer ones The ethereum Killers those are obviously the biggest most sought-after platforms and they get massive valuations the problem with l1's this cycle versus last cycle is that most of them are trading in the multi-billion dollar valuations whereas last cycle you could literally have bought salana for $50 million for $100 million around the start of the bull run around this particular time last Bull Run you could have gotten into Soul at under 100 Mil so you know most of these cool l1s are trading above a billion and so you're looking at just a different value prop again the Market's bigger so these could end up growing way bigger this time but it's just not as much of a steel deal as I think gaming Ai and memes are so here I actually have my Consolidated portfolio um and I have some percentages here uh these are things you could play around with depending on your conviction again I didn't put uh any percentages next to projects that I've co-founded or that I'm contributing to or have contributed to because uh I'm not allowed to but in the end just know that these are my highest convictions like these are the ones that I know exactly what's going on I don't have to guess on what the team or the foundation might do and that's really X Factor so any of these things you know eventually the truth is that there's humans Behind these projects and what they do can dramatically affect the tokenomics the unlocks all of these things have massive effects but this is the base Port right you have the eth Bitcoin salana coinbase uh play around with your percentages whatever you think is right and yeah have fun with it again these are just some metrics some some basic starting points that I think are easy uh to start with feel free to mix and match I just think you should get a significant chunk of your portfolio in your high conviction bucket and I do recognize that this now sums uh 75% not 60% you can make e 10% if you want and coinbase stock 10% here whatever you want to do that's on you for gaming immutable obviously I'm a seed investor this is the the biggest coin and they have the most games and they are going to be in many ways a leading indicator for gaming as a whole if immutable starts ripping almost all these coins are going to start ripping but of course beam is another very very strong infr play I've been very bullish on both of these since the bottom and then you have Ronin which has one of the biggest user bases and one of the biggest platforms and of course superverse I personally obviously uh am very passionate about this one you can think of super as the community coin of gaming as the currency of gaming the coin that is in every single game regardless of whatever chain it's on regardless of whatever stack it's using this is how the community flows between all of the games and it's effectively the gaming cult and that's why if you go on the timeline you'll see people going crazy showing their love for super because in my opinion it's the most fun way to get involved in all of the gaming projects and it's a good first stop and I believe it will be the first stop for most people as they come into crypto gaming this is your simple sort of platform play obviously for games um I'm a really big fan of carrot I'm a really big fan of gonzilla they have off the grid and I'm also a big fan of super Champs their token isn't out yet though all right time for the memes now if you remember I told you guys that the way to play memes are to play established memes to not go dumpster diving for the new stuff that stuff could work out treated as a lotto ticket any new meme can be treated as a lotto ticket however when you look at the things that have been insane performers this cycle and really are coming off of the lows of this recent dip things like Pepe things like MOG are coins that I just am really really bullish on I've been bullish on them since the beginning and seeing how they perform through this dip I mean look MOG is already absolutely ripping here you can see MOG is already ripping here off of the lows it bought out here at what is it around 7 70 whatever now it's about double that so it's it's almost 2x off the lows here and you can see it's starting to really hook back up here and try to get back to those highs that's what you want to see you want to see coins that are hooking back up and want to challenge those prior highs if I were to do two meme coins and two meme coins only I do Pepe and I do mog those are obviously on eth so if you want more Soul exposure dog with hat that's the big Soul coin and then you got to show some love to popcat I mean this is honestly of all the meme coins this has been the craziest chart look look at this it's at all-time highs right now it's over a billion dollars the most recent coin to join the billion dollar meme coin club I'm actually coping a bit I sold this thing around 8 cents so yeah I'm a little bit bummed cuz I would have had a really big popcat position but much love to the popcat fam they have absolutely crushed it and the charts don't lie this thing is nuts so if you want some Blue Chip whatever that means exposure on memes uh on Soul You' want to go dog with hat uh or popcat of course if you want Brett Brett again is the main one on Bas those are where you're seeing the strong performance obviously there's a ton more you could go to I mean there's just a ton of memes and maybe you can find your favorite cult here there's a ton that will probably do well but my thing is keeping it simple and wanting to go with size and with high conviction into what I think the best coins are because I also believe that the best meme coins will end up going astronomically High remember it was Doge and shibainu last cycle that went and took up like 95% of the market and so I think Pepe is kind of setting itself up to do that this cycle and maybe a few more will come along to get that really astronomical upside but there's only so many coins that can be in the tens of billions and in my opinion you want to find your favorite of those and go hard on those and that's why I've only accumulated Pepe and MOG though I do think if you find your favorite cult on this list go ahead join the cult be long Colts be long hardcore communities just why people want to understand the magic of why superverse is outperforming a lot of the rest of the gaming space it's because it's not just a single game or a single Tech stack or just business announcements it is a hardcore community that we've built here over now 7 years ERS and people love to join hardcore communities that are not going away that's fun and that inspires confidence when you see a community continue to grow through the hard times and the good times that's what's fun look for that in memes look for that in other projects as well and I will be doing actually a full-blown meme coin video again I know risky business but let's be real memes will continue to be a huge part of this Market gaming AI memes those are the three biggest categories in my opinion of this cycle and so I'll be doing deep dives into all of them continually let me know if you guys are excited for that one and of course I'll be going into a lot of projects I didn't mention here now we also have rwas again this is a black rock play uh straight up I have about 3% of my portfolio in that I'll be showing you my particular approach to rwas I definitely think that there's going to be a lot of success here and it'll come seasonally right whenever the rwa season kicks off that's when you'll see a lot of movement and there's probably a ton of RW that will perform much like AI though I think that it's not about necessarily the one winner there will be one or two winners but there will be a ton of trash that fly kind of like AI there will be a ton of lower down tickers like metaverse Mania last cycle pretty much anything that said metaverse went crazy and it didn't matter the quality of it it was just if it was a metaverse it was going to go nuts and so you kind of wanted to get like that bottom basement dirty dgen pick type of allocation to this Market because when it did go those went up 10 20 30 100x again I'm a big fan of finding category leaders so we will be looking to do so again with rwas hopping over to AI aosh AOS Destra bit tensor these are the simple ones if you want simple ones obviously there are lower more D gen ones but if I was consolidating my portfolio around seeing what happened over the last several months yes there are a ton that will fly again I still own a lot more than are listed here but those are the ones I'd be looking at if I was looking to start a Consolidated portfolio today and again some people are fighting uh to bit tensor because it has a ton of unlocks coming like 50% unlocks I forgot the exact stat but again when the bull market kicks in those things start to get pushed to the side and you just want M share and bit tensor has insane mind share again and things like Aether have Big M share though they have sitting on massive ftvs net mine did really good at the beginning of the cycle and has corrected a ton so that might get another leg again once AI season kicks off all of these lower down coins might be the ones you want to focus on in small quantities because like I said AI right now is mostly a meme people don't know the final form of AI people don't know which applications or which onchain protocols will actually dominate so it will trade mostly just on narrative and hype so remember that and treat them in my opinion like meme coins that's how I suggest people treat AI they should treat it like a sub genre of memes finally layer ones Celestia and say those are the two that I think are worth focusing on though you know there's a ton of l1s that people want to focus on maybe we haven't seen the salana like wild community pop from the L1 crowd yet I will say the bar chain party that we saw in token 2049 was absolutely insane like this was overflowing over the rafters so be chain has a massive Community it has a ton of onchain Primitives interesting chain to look at and monad I'm a big investor in monad this one is also planned to be a massive cook whenever those tokens do come out hopefully in Q4 around that time we can see these two launch but again these are unlaunched so we don't know what their valuations will be we don't know what the upside will look like but it could be very well that we haven't seen the salana of this cycle even launch yet so say's chart looks great because if you look at say you can see Hey look it's still over 50% down from the high almost 60% down from the high it bottomed here around maybe 70% down from the high what was this uh 24 cents and it was up here at a dollar yeah so 75% off the high and now it's pretty much doubled back up so you can see it's made a nice strong move the lows are probably in here and we'll look to see it do some multiples of this $1 figure but again you're getting in on a coin that is trading at 1.6 billion salana last cycle you could get in at 100 Mil so you're not getting the same low prices that you could last cycle which is why layer ones are cool who knows how high these can go but it's still just not quite as amazing of a bargain as last cycle and Celestia you know this is the modular narrative last year so we'll see if say and tia these were some of the early Darlings that we covered I hope you guys can appreciate that we're trying to really follow up and stick with the best performers early in the cycle and continue with them grow with them throughout the cycle CU that's the way that probably 99% of this audience on YouTube can play the game and I've tried really hard not to do this high-risk High reward quick flip type of approach because it's not something that I believe that is easy to follow and so if you appreciate me not only creating strategies that are easy to follow along here on YouTube but sticking with them myself so I'm in the boat with you guys at all times I think that that's why we're doing things wildly differently here on the channel and if you appreciate that show me some love down below and I'm pretty excited to continue to do this what I consider to be kind of a new method it's definitely not a method I think everybody does certainly some awesome content creators like Alex and other ones definitely do this as well so shout out to everyone doing this which is significantly harder and it requires a ton of long-term focus and restraint out of us content creators while I will be doing a full gaming video very soon and I will have a huge super verse update on that one believe me the news coming out is super it's just crazy how much news there is I can almost not fit it into these videos without it kind of messing with the format of the video I don't want these videos to be all about super I want to deliver all kinds of news and value to you but there's just so much news right now with super there's even more coming up in this case ton station which is the new product being launched by superverse you can see that has now hit 10 million users on telegram which makes it now in the running to start competing as one of the biggest platforms on Telegram and you can see now superverse has having a token in every game having a game store that has tens of millions of users to push into Partners you can see how superverse becomes a centrifugal force in the middle of the crypto gaming movement and I'm very excited if you haven't joined tun station make sure you do there's a link in the description and there's going to be all kinds of airdrops you can Farm there and even more fun if you're farming there and also a super Staker again more details coming up on all that very soon now for those of you who are new here there is only one sponsor that we've had on this channel for the last year and a half and that is is nordvpn and that's because I really believe this product is the best-in-class VPN and if you're in crypto you absolutely need a VPN to protect your data from leaking to Bad actors who want your coins they want your name they want your address nordvpn is just a couple of dollars a month in fact you get a massive juicy discount if you use my link in the description below it's a product that I use at all times I'm using it right now and I highly suggest you try this out it's got a money back guarantee so if you don't like the speeds or the service in any way you can get your money back it's literally risk-free but like I've said many times before there are tons of mistakes that you can be forgiven for making here in cryptand in fact ogs make mistakes all the time but not using a VPN is silly that's a rookie mistake and you won't be forgiven for that so make sure you sign up for nordvpn and doing so with my link supports the channel so I appreciate it once again thank you to nordvpn for sponsoring this video all right there you have it that's my Consolidated portfolio overview again a lot to chew on but I'll be going deep into each sector uncovering stones and projects that I didn't talk about here this is not all this is certainly not all that I have in my bag but this is like a highlevel approach a simplified approach to rebuilding your portfolio here towards the end of 2024 and the way I see the market right now especially based on how things have performed over the last year we now have a year of performance to judge on let me know if you guys enjoyed this make sure to follow me on Twitter at elot trades if you guys want to see more content from me obviously I post there way more often usually multiple times a day videos have been a couple of times a week at most here though I will be kicking that up as always thanks for watching and I'll see you soon on the the next episode [Music]",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing a mix of sentiments, with Bitcoin recently making its first higher high in over six months, signaling a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish trend. However, the overall sentiment remains bearish, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating \"Extreme Fear\" at a reading of 15[1]. The market has been volatile, with Bitcoin experiencing significant price fluctuations and altcoins showing potential for substantial gains.\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin Outlook:** Despite recent price drops, Bitcoin is expected to rise, with some predictions suggesting it could reach $91,467 by early March 2025, representing a 9.15% increase[1]. Long-term predictions are even more optimistic, with some analysts like Tom Lee from Fundstrat expecting Bitcoin to exceed $150,000 in 2025[4].\n\n- **Altcoin Trends:** Altcoins, particularly those outside the top 10, are expected to see significant growth. Categories like gaming, AI, and memes are highlighted as potential high-growth areas. Coins like Pepe and MOG are noted for their strong performance in the meme category[5].\n\n- **Stocks and DeFi Opportunities:** Coinbase stock is mentioned as a solid investment within the crypto space, offering a more traditional play on the market[5].\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Predictions:** \n  - **Bitcoin:** Short-term predictions suggest a rise to $91,467, while long-term forecasts see it potentially exceeding $150,000[1][4].\n  - **Altcoins:** Some altcoins are expected to see 10x to 100x gains as the market rallies[5].\n\n- **Risk Warnings:** The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and investments carry significant risk. Regulatory changes and market sentiment shifts can lead to sudden price drops, as seen recently with Bitcoin[3].\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Portfolio Diversification:** Investors are advised to diversify their portfolios, allocating a significant portion to high-conviction assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, while also exploring higher-risk, higher-reward categories like gaming and AI[5].\n\n- **Risk Management:** Given the volatility of the market, it's crucial to manage risk through diversification and staying informed about market trends and regulatory changes.\n\n- **Investment Strategy:** Consider a mix of stable, high-conviction investments alongside speculative plays in emerging categories. Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.",

    "transcript": "range bound Bitcoin and the rest of the market shrug off the biggest liquidation event in crypto's history but BTC seems stuck below 100K flooding The Zone it's all happening in Washington DC as regulatory bodies adjust to the new regime and Trump's crypto Zar sets out the store is crypto entering a golden age Bears on the Rampage retail sentiment goes from bad to worse as fears grow that alt season may be cancelled have we been here before or is this time different and a look at last week's top performers tweets of the week dates for your diary and much more besides this is the coin Bureau news live GM afternoon or evening uh my name is Nick of course joining you live from Dubai and hi guy where are you joining us from uh hi Nick good to see you I yes I am in a uh I am in an undisclosed location um but you'll be happy to see it comes it comes with robes so uh yeah I thought I I robes have become a bit of a thing the fans were speculating in the comments whether you were going to be wearing a robe so you managed to Source it very I I hate to disappoint our fans you know that Nick um now Mrs guy and I decided to just get away for a few days um get away from crypto for a few days uh I there's quite a funny story which I'll tell you next week um about how that didn't quite turn out as planned um we can see here you are on a crypto live stream when you're supposed to be away relaxing but you can take of but you can't take crypto out of the DJ right absolutely absolutely and yet that as well that as well so all will be revealed uh next week but um yeah let's let's stick with this week um what's been going on it's been um it's been an interesting one hasn't it it has indeed so we've got a lot to talk about guys obviously um the Bitcoin price what's going on with the regulatory changes in the US and of course the The Never Ending question will we see alt season or is alt season dead but I think as we usually do let's start off this at the top of the stream with a look at what's going on with Bitcoin at the Bitcoin price um so let's start exactly with last week if we can cast our minds back to last week guy um when uh the new when trade war was just started when news were war with ch with Canada and Mexico those um those Infamous nemesises of of us were started and yes mostly caused a massive selloff in the crypto markets and all risk on assets in general right yeah yeah now this was this was crazy like at because the initial figure that we were given we knew we knew that there had been some big liquidations but the in initial figure we were given was around $2 billion do worth um and uh Ben the CEO of uh biit um weigh in on on Twitter sort of like I I hate to break it to you guys but it is a lot worse than that um obviously you know these guys at the exchanges have uh have access to all sorts of uh all sorts of data um so uh yeah it was what it was I mean so essentially at these exchanges um the there are limit in terms of like how many calls can be made to the apis from these Data Tracking sites in terms of the total amount of liquidations and um obviously it's limited in a particular period of time and as a result um Ben came out and admitted look guys you know the numbers you've seen uh were nowhere near were how bad the liquidations were indeed probably has been undercounted for a number of years now so exchanges definitely do need to update the ularity of their feeds in terms of liquidations but anyways that was a massive altcoin liquidation that happened on Monday um but of course um you can see from the charts here we later in the day um Trump came out and said well look we're going to be extending the deadline for those sanctions not sanctions um you know tariffs um where we're going to be delaying them for a month so one month you've got a delay so we can we can breathe easy from the Canada Mexico USA trade War for one month uh um you know but of course you know the question is going to have to come again in at the end of February right so we'll see what if that's going to impact in the markets um surprisingly though last week U Michael sailor of micro strategy he did not buy sorry Nick sorry Nick I I I've got to correct you there Michael sailor of strategy um course strategy he's updated updated the name Logo there is only one strategy there is no other strategy so he did not b although he did elude this week to potentially yesterday you know his in his his tweet with this Michael sailor tracker he did allude to potentially another um Green Dot coming so you know let's if you guys obviously we live now so if he does indeed announce a buy that happened last week guys let us know in the comments and we can react to it live um but there could be a micr or there could be a strategy by coming uh this week or during the Stream I'm looking I'm looking at Twitter now uh nick uh sailor posted 17 minutes ago uh mstr has acquired 7,633 BTC for $ 7424 million um at a at an average buy of around 97,2 155 per BTC um so they now hold $478,500 BTC congratulations to congratulations Michael sailor off strategy there we go guys so he's bought again um and it's another buy below 100K so he's locking in those uh on sale Bitcoin on sale below 100K um other news last week um of course we had the uh my David saxs um the AI and crypto Zar he held his press conference where a lot of uh policies were or like you know policies and Clarity in terms of Regulation and potential legislation uh class markets in In classical in True Form you know bought the news sold the event so there was a lot of runup beforehand and they bought on the announcement of the press conference coming and then sold and dumped imediately afterwards um we'll be talking about this in a bit but it's mostly related to the wording around this strategic Bitcoin Reserve um and then on Friday we had unemployment numbers and we talked about this last week now it was a mixed bag so because we had um unemployment rate came in a bit lower than expected at 4% versus 4.1% expected but uh the econom added Less jobs than was expected so it was a bit of a mixed bag Market did rally initially but then the moment the crypto Market rallied initially but when the US Equity markets opened obviously it fell um so yeah that's what happened last week but now we have started a new week with new tariffs and um yeah so this was announced last night and of course um Trump new tariffs on steel and aluminum aluminium depending on where you are in the world and uh this this morning of course tanked Bitcoin and crypto we've got a nice little tweet here is ethereum made of aluminum because it tanked after that and um yeah so it's true it's uh and then of course China responds as well so we've now got this tid fortat trade war going on that's causing a lot of uh fear in the markets um and the markets are indeed fearful checks this out this is the CMC crypto fear and greed index now guy note this is the lowest level it's been since September of last year and I will note that was a time when Bitcoin was trading at 59k when there was no Clarity around what was going on with us election that was just after Germany had finished gting their their Bitcoin bags so wow the uh the the lights have gone here for coming it's it kind of says it all really don't but there we are I've got a torch on my I have a contingency plan nice sort of uh you got a backup generator as well oh there we go okay cool wow never a dull moment um yeah so fear and greed so I mean yeah this was back where so the last time the the fear and greed index was like this this was back before we knew that Trump was uh was coming in so we were potentially facing um you know another four years of a of a crypto hostile uh Administration so kind of all that Trump Goodwill uh has now evaporated it's all important yeah exactly I mean yeah well I mean to be honest things that have happened subsequent to the inauguration potentially which we we will be talking about soon obviously in terms of altcoins especially um but also as it relates potentially on the positive side like to a look take a look at this um funding rates on Bitcoin now this is Futures funding rates um and you can see that it's now the lowest funding rates since o August as well which is potentially a bullish sign in the sense that we've had the deleveraging right and there's not too much long exposure demand for long exposure in the Futures Market which means that if we are going to have a rally up it's going to be you know more sustained less idiosyncratic and driven by liquidation risk so that's potentially looking bullish um in the Futures Market um this is from on Twitter we also have on looking at some onchain stats to give you guys some hopium uh this is the net transfer volume from or to exchanges and one on one day last week we had the largest uh outflow from exchanges since August which means of course people are wanting to whales and crypto holders are wanting to huddle their Bitcoin um and I mean this is also something that whales are whales are also accumulating in terms of wallet stats you can see we've been in um recing here pull up the yeah and pull up the chart of the Wales wallets there we go so Wales have been accumulating and the people who are not Wales been Distributing the distribution or the accumulation of wealth by the Wales continues um and I mean this is something that we can see on Wall Street R gu yeah I mean this was this is one of the most um this is one of the most discussed tweets that I've seen this this week um and yeah Matt Hogan obviously of uh bitwise um and yeah I I think this sums it up perfectly you know there is huge amounts of institutional interest Wall Street uh want to get into Bitcoin um we're going to discuss some of the you know some of the other products that are available to you know to Wall Street and institutional investors a bit later on so there's this hugely really kind of positive sentiment around uh Bitcoin um but the you know because uh because retail is is altcoin heavy um you know sentiment in that on that side of the market is is just terrible and we're going to obviously discuss that in a bit more detail later on as well but yeah really sums up very nicely I think the the the the disconnect at the moment you know between institutional and and and Retail in terms of in terms of sentiment yep indeed and um some more bullish news to quickly look at on the macro front um is one is the breakdown in the dollar Index um it's been it's broken through this this trend line that we've seen now obviously a breakdown in the dollar strength is potentially good for risk on assets and we are also seeing um a breakdown in the 10-year yield right and this is also very important from the perspective of concerns around inflation and um pricing in the economy and obviously uh this is something that could potentially be bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin so that was obviously last week quick take a look quickly taking a look at what could happen this week um because that's what you guys are most interested in obviously uh we've got still on the macro front um tariffs potentially you know there could be European tariffs as we mentioned uh there could be more retaliation uh there's also the CPI print um on Wednesday and the PPI on Thursday which we will discuss macro events very important for fed policy um in terms of the charts quickly pull up this chart over here I just show you in terms of the Bitcoin on the 2hour 2our time frame it's in this descending wedge pattern um and it could potentially reach uh the you know resistance there at 98k which is a key point to watch especially from the point of liquidation levels as well in the Futures markets um but if you do guys do want to play byplay of what's going on in the markets in terms of how to trade it and what's happening in the charts of course I will refer you to the coin buau trading Channel we've got Dan our head of research Aaron Moon and papa who is the moon and papa um marianao from the trading parrot and um Mariana just released a video yesterday on what's happening in this week and what key levels to watch and Aon has got a video going out in I believe two hours or so on his trading strategy this trading strategy for making money in this market so if guys you guys want to subscribe we at 69 um you can subscribe in the we at 69420 subscribers we can want to get to 70,000 subscribers the QR code's right on the top top uh left of the top right of the screen there so you guys can hit that subscribe and go and join the guys over at coin buau trading yeah get them up to 70k mind you if they once they get you know the the more subscribers they get them the more insufferable they become those uh those coin Bureau trading Lads I mean lovely guys but you know getting getting very pleased with themselves these days the 100K level it's like that's the hollow that's more so than the Bitcoin 100K get coin bu trading above 100K boom get a PL there we go guys do Qui that's the metric yes let's have a look at the sentiment so I've been uh as you've been as we've been discussing um I've been just sort of looking through some of the comments seeing just what the mind what the minds is in the comments I'm kind of like yeah I enjoyed this one honey it's all gone again uh yeah um yeah there's a lot of lost um we've also got we've also got we pushed a poll earlier in the first time in the in the comments and I think it was about whe whether we'll see an ALT season is something we can refer to but later but 70% thinks we will so that's cool okay that's good good to see people um are still hopeful um there's quite a few people or c they were at some point um getting a little pissed off with uh leverage Traders obviously lever you know uh leverage Longs getting wiped out has uh helped sort of tank prices further so a lot of people losing patience with our uh with our trading friends um look guys I know it's annoying but you know uh take comfor in the fact that they're losing extraordinary amounts of money so they're probably not they're Los and gives you the opportunity to buy right at discounted prices right their loss is your game right it's a zero some game right you guys pick it up you know for every loser there must be a winner and then the exchanges win the most because they get all the fees but you know whatever um AB cool also have um coin biscuit in the uh in the chat as well I haven't heard of these guys but I'm sure they're um I'm sure they're the next big thing so keep a look out for coin biscuit um okay should we uh should we move on and talk about um what's what's been going on in Washington because like obviously it's not been it's not been great for prices thanks to to uh thanks to everything that we've um been talking about um but over in Washington DC we are seeing a heck of a lot of stuff going down that it's been a fantastically busy week from that point of view um not only is the administration um kind of breaking you breaking their silence a bit we're going to talk about that David Sach speech but we're also seeing pretty significant shakeups at the at the Regulatory Agencies the regulatory bodies uh that oversee crypto so um you know we've got change of foot at places like the SEC the cftc uh We've also got the FED sort of talking more positively perhaps about crypto than it has for a very long time so yeah it's it feels like um it feels like there's a lot happening and most of it sort of taking us in the right direction exactly yeah so going through some of the stuff that happened last week um you know as we mentioned and alluded to earlier we had the speech from David saxs and basically there was a lot of stuff that was covered there um he said the house and the Senate are going to collaborate to advance digital asset legislation proposed an oversight Bill between state agencies and federal regulators and also potentially Revival of fit21 Bill now remember guy this was the one that I think passed the house the financial innovation technology Act of 21 passed the house last year and it was killed in the Senate on a threat from veto from Biden um so that's a lot of people are excited about that's potentially something that could be revived um and uh you know uh so there's a lot of uh and he also said that that a he would prioritize us dominance in digital assets and calls for crypto a week one priority um of course many people were cons were you know crypto people are very sentiment is very fleeting right so essentially they didn't yeah apparently the transision from the word Bitcoin strategic Reserve which was initially what was said when we going when he was elected Trump was evolved to National digital ass digital asset stockpile to now apparently assessing the feasibility of Reserve which in government speak assessing the feasibility of something is genely means yeah you know I mean it's going to be filed somewhere else yeah I mean hopefully not though but that's why people that's why Bitcoin kind of sold off because it was kind of soft in the wording having said that there was positives um speaking about the stable coin Bill the one that seems to be the most likely to pass it's now being renamed the genius act being sponsored by Senator Bill haggy um this is one that could potentially pass um it has the most chance to because it's got bipartisan support the stable coin one did last year so this is exciting right yeah yeah and I mean you know if it kind of It kind of Suits both parties this in in that it suits the the crypto industry to get stable coin regulations passed because that I think is going to be able to unlock a whole load of you know potential and Innovation it's going to give much needed Clarity around you know not just around stable coins I think I think that Clarity will sort of will filter through to the to the wider industry um but obviously the Killer is that it's kind of you know the current Administration are very aware that stable coins are a great way to um you know to further spread the dominance of the US dollar and for all the stable coins that are created and bought that means well certainly US dollar denominated stable coins which I think is basically all of them um you know every every stable coin that gets created that's another dollar of of US Government debt being bought behind scenes massive passive fire of US Government debt exactly yeah and a tether and circle now between them um by you know more treasuries more us treasuries than you know a fair few countries I think I can't remember exactly where they were in the league table they're quite a way behind I think more if I recall it's more than Norway I think if I recall they hold more sovereign debt Us treasuries in Norway or something like that or Germany one of these but it was one of the one European country um so yeah big news on the stable coin front also SEC updates now I don't know if you caught this last week a lot of people were gushing over this speech by or this statement by H Pier obviously the commissioner who's now working on this digital asset framework at the SEC and uh she put forward this the called the Journey Begins how inspirational is that it was her owed to the crypto industry um and she said the SEC is carbing out A New Path for the digital asset sector which includes evaluating the security status of certain asset is important right because now we we have certainty around what is a security no longer Gary's guessing game you know is it a security or not you know Bingo um so that's exciting uh potentially also retroactive retroactive relief right for potential um people that have been sued by the ACC right yeah yeah now this would be I mean this would be huge because this this you would imagine brings to an end uh the era of Regulation by enforcement and I think hopefully this will this will be able to kind of wipe the Slate clean in a way and say you know and let's face it how many millions of US taxpayers Dollars have been wasted on suing all these crypto companies already um and mostly mostly in a for you know for no tangible result you know the sec's had uh so many losses in court it's yeah I it makes it makes perfect sense I think from from every angle just to draw a line under it 100% and then there's also one more thing potentially approvals for new enforcement has to go through the Commissioners so it's no longer just going rogue as the litigators themselves they have to actually take these potential new enforcement actions through the likes of H Pierce and UA and the new Atkins as he comes in there was one other piece of news as well which is interesting guy I don't know if you saw this but they also are reducing their 50 person um crypto enforcement unit reassigning some lawyers and apparently one of the crypto unit's top lawyers was moved from enforcement into the IT department okay so you went from being a high fly serving cases to crypto companies to basically answering questions on servers and [ __ ] yeah have you tried turning it off and on again number what's number sorry I'm trying to deal with that I've got a lot of coming in um well it'll probably be an easier life he'll probably you know it'll probably be an improvement for him um I I think I got to go just going back to what you were saying Nick about um approvals for enforcement now have to go through the Commissioners it's kind of crazy that that wasn't the case to start with wasn't it it's kind of giving enormous amount of free reign to presumably not all that high up people at the SEC to be like yeah you want to take you want to uh bring in enforcement action against the crypto company yeah you go for it yeah yeah yeah you do your thing yeah it's like surely that that should go that should come from the top like surely the commissioner should be cons exactly especially Gary is the one who's getting like pulled in for front of Congress and being castigated by lawmakers um yeah but yeah uh there was also some updates from a few more Regulatory Agencies um positive of course cftc the acting chair also push put out a statement saying she's going to stop regulation they want to stop regulation by enforcement against quote good citizens um and we also had the another federal agencies the fed the Federal Reserve and the OCC um and this is according to the New York Post they will loosen the tough stance they've had on digital assets but specifically as it relates to uh choke point 2.0 and banking services and um allow or big Banks to as well service crypto clients which is something they've always wanted to do right yeah and again this is this is one of those bullish bullish bits of news that I think that a lot of people haven't sort of digested or or given enough credit to recently you operation chokepoint 2.0 has been a huge you know a huge Cloud hanging over the crypto industry and now that that is being Unwound that is going to again it's such it's such a sort of long-term bullish thing for the whole industry especially the industry in the United States but that will Ripple out Beyond it um and again I I I think a lot of people are sort of forgetting that you know when when they're sort of judging judging the state of the market but um yeah I mean that's that's great news because that will make it easier for for crypto companies to innovate and flourish in the US and just get banking it's it's crazy that that was you know that wasn't possible most important thing for a company just being able to pay employees as a crypto company having a bank finally um another thing else another thing that was another executive order guy which is pretty interesting do you ever think you you hear the stage at which a US the US government would Institute or establish a sovereign wealth fund this one this one was definitely surprising for me I mean my first thought when I heard this and I think the first thought of a number of people was well yeah Sovereign wealth fund should you not think about paying off the 30 5 36 trillion dollars of of national debt would that not be a better way to start than kind of you know starting a sovereign yeah exactly but I mean it could be a way to grow you know yeah I mean to strategically grow and especially in the the uh acquiring shares and uh strategic assets like I was there was talk apparently Trump is thinking to use this to get shares in Tik Tok um that's something the US Sovereign welfare fund um it's basically like he's treating he potentially treat The Sovereign wealth fund like that um the spack the um Trump digital media what basically a blank check company to go and purchase all the world's assets from Canada to Greenland wherever um but another positive news from on terms of like local um level in the US as well just quickly um there are at least 22 States I think that are con are thinking about Bitcoin reserves so it's not just on the federal level yeah and I think a lot of people believe that actually when it comes to the idea of a of a strategic Reserve it's it it'll probably begin at the state level um rather than being a national thing and and and actually like US states have for for a few years now been a lot more uh you know individually have been a lot more proactive than the US government all throughout the Biden Administration you know States like Wyoming and Texas were sort of trying trying to kind of you know adopt a much more crypto friendly and much more crypto positive uh stance so um it's yeah I I I'm not surprised that that that they're sort of embracing the idea of of a stockpile and what was interesting is that not all obviously all those states are colored orange on the map as they should be but um there's there's a mixture of Republican and Democrat held States in that map so again it's not necessarily a partisan thing there are there are politicians there are State Governors on both you know of both Stripes who who want this yeah it's a bipartisan issue non-political it should just be about preserving the wealth of your of your citizens right um cool so now of course we're going to roll with the Wall of Shame and [Music] fame I was not expecting that I almost We R back to the brokeback the brokeback version come on what who isn't that from what's that movie guy it's a British from Hot Fuzz hot FS Hot Fuzz great movie great movie yeah I'd rather be that guy than you guy to be honest yeah thanks thanks for that thanks for that coin Bureau production team just because I'm not there in the studio to uh to let you know my displeasure um I I'll be back don't you worry um yeah it is time for the walls of Shame and fame um so yeah we're gonna we're gonna know who's on the wall today guys guy you want to tell us why we here we go yes is none other than Dave pornoy bar stool Sports uh Mogul um Pizza connoisseur and now also um mecoin Schiller um yeah yeah he's he he has had a busy weekend so I was going back through his Twitter so tldr is that basically now I I should we we need to be really clear here he didn't create any meme coins himself but he certainly started Shilling some he he suddenly fell down the mcoin degenerate rabbit hole and started just Shilling these things all over Twitter sort of saying well you know I'm I'm going to be buying I'm going to be selling or whatever sort of but you know going as far as posting Phantom wallet screenshots um and it's it was one of those kind of interventions from outside of crypto by you know a famous person that just it comes at a time when you know crypto is is not exactly you know not exactly having the best of weeks and you're just like thanks Dave yeah this is just what we needed Dave por Dave por Shilling meme coins this is yeah this is exactly crypto Twitter was universally against this um and it was just crazy was a few meme coins as well stol presidenta which I what was it the jail stool which was actually listed on Kraken crazy Kraken what you like honestly I I saw that well I mean anyway such a busy weekend like it was Super Bowl it was a Super Bowl yesterday wasn't it so like obviously big weekend like I was going back through his Twitter feed I don't know how he managed to watch any of the game he was just so busy Shilling meme coins and tweeting the whole time like this guy is very online C more fun he's clearly having more fun with us um mean you make more money bit you know a meme coin to your audience than bitting on Sports um but anyways we have someone else who we've always mentioned on the worldall of Fame and this is Go drum roll please drum roll please nope oh that was that was from P Noy themed artwork we go back to we can go back to that that was poroy um image from um what's it people um yeah very graphic of course um SPF out there um and Hawk oh hawk in the cornin so Hawk tour is there as well that's another there's always so much detail we don't that's another rabbit hole we can't go down right now Wall of Fame guys um we've got uh as we mentioned before H Pi the crypto mom she gets a special shout out in course because of her you know very thought ful statement and owed to the crypto space and she's she's the real one she's the MVP she's been there since day one yeah yeah she is a long a longstanding Ally of the crypto industry more power to her um so yeah well done well done Hester Pierce thumbs up for Hester thumbs down for Dave porno not that uh not that he cares thumbs down for alquin season mate which brings us of course to the next topic which I'm sure many people are wondering what's going on here and this has been the the biggest discussion last week and I know we talked about it last week as well and um it caused a bit of a discussion as well within our coin Bureau Club Discord server as well um but I think it's it's all over the timeline all over the timeline there's just terrible apathy about we're not going to see altcoin season it's not coming guys you know it's just a Bitcoin rally and um so what kicked us off of course last week it was kicked off by that massive deleveraging we had right um it was the biggest before we pull this CH up guys basically this was the biggest deleveraging since Co Luna and FDX right in terms of total notional altcoin uh liquidations was the biggest D leverag in ever and yeah what's I decided to go back and take a look at this as well because these previous D leveraging events and this is the um what we've got here is the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin so I.E altcoin market cap and I went back to those previous periods where you've get had these deleveraging events Co Luna and FTX and at a minimum it takes at least historically right it would took at least 7 27 days um to reach to to recover those losses um in terms of the altcoin market cap uh so you know it's one of these things where that's historically and that's what I think potentially something to to take into account if we are thinking about where we whether we'll see a outco season of any type um so yeah about at least more more than two months ago yeah I think it's worth pointing out as well though like you know as we said this is the biggest deleveraging since ft X obviously prices have taken a beating but you know back back in back in the FTX days back in the Luna days back in you know going further back to covid something like this would have been people would have been talking about an extinction level event people would have been going is this it because I mean it felt it certainly felt like at at those times maybe not Luna but certainly like FTX and now it I I think that the you know people understand that the crypto Market is is a lot stronger than it was then and yeah this is this has been pretty ugly to see this kind of deleveraging I I I want to take some positives from it though because I think the market dealt with this and kind of showed its maturity um through this so I you know it's it's certainly not a a complete positive but I think there are positives to be taken from it yeah 100% um but just quickly taking a look at another thing I mean the question now not just about altcoin the total market cap of of the altcoin space which is something that could recover will recover and could Val the question comes down to and this is something I like to look come back to it's altcoin relative to altcoin market cap relative to bitcoin right or Bitcoin relative to the the altcoin space right so that's or the total market cap and that's Bitcoin dominance um so if you take a look at this chart as well um this is from wrecked capital on Twitter and his theory and as he posits here is that we had we had an altcoin season already it was a mini rally in terms of one of the criteria for altcoin season was a mini rally in the altcoin market cap which is of course a fall in Bitcoin dominance which happened from November to about you know December um so very small short altcoin season that's now basically been trumped by Bitcoin Going On An Almighty Rally or Bitcoin dominance going on on a rally as well and he followed on from this potentially we could see Bitcoin dominance going to like 71% before any sort of altcoin season can start to Blossom um so that's on the charts and the Bitcoin dominant side and guy I think that one of the discussions it's had right now and there something I feel as well is the reason why this particular altcoin season will never won't be as big as the last ones is because of the way the market structure is changed in the crypto space because of ETFs and they unique impact on bitcoin market cap because obviously Bitcoin are as you people accumulate Bitcoin ETF shares and and ETF providers accumulate Bitcoin Bitcoin AUM it leads to a growth in the price of Bitcoin and market cap relative to Els and there was actually interesting insightful report from glass node last week with two particular charts I wanted to point out so the first one this is the correlation between um the Bitcoin major asset market caps correlation of Bitcoin and the altcoin market caps and it's got very close to strong correlation so close to one so a strong correlation and what and yet the market caps have have diverged and glass node concludes quote suggest that the driver of the Divergence is not the rate of growth between the two but instead a substantial Divergence in capital entering Bitcoin relative to the altcoin sector so translated that's that the capital enter in the Bitcoin space is through large institutional investors through ETFs right yeah yeah it's I it's being kind of I I guess you could say it's being sort of siloed isn't it the the the the capital that's going into Bitcoin in previous cycles that would all go into the sort of same that would all end up in the same big pot of you know crypto whereas now it's sort of been a lot of it is being siloed off and it's being you know it the ETFs are kind of almost a sort of separate Market aren't they not so easy to uh not straightforward at all to rotate out of and I think the investor profile of the sort of people and institutions that are buying those uh ETFs you know because for them well for us Bitcoin is you know Bitcoin is a safe asset isn't it Bitcoin is our is our flight to safety for most regular investors and certainly for a lot of Institutions you know Bitcoin for them is like whoa you know this is this is really risky we're you know they don't see it the same way that we in the crypto industry do so I think that's important to that's probably for a lot of people just BTC thank you very much that's risky enough you know they don't the the altcoin casino is not one that they want to uh to drop into anytime soon exactly yeah and it's also difficult to rotate because of the fact that these are ETF shares um one other point that the from the glass node that I'll just rais is the um decline small wallet transfers uh compared to previous cycle tops which obviously just shows that it's big wall big sized entities that are buying this so This suggests that new demand for BTC has been dominated by larger sized entities rather than small retail sized entities and this is quite this tweet is quite aopo and this is from Jeff Park the head of alpha strategies at bitwise and here's the the case he's making here is look in the past institutions and larger investors would U would use the altcoin space as a lever beta on bitcoin so essentially you get more gains and um and uh volatility from Els than you would from just holding Bitcoin however given regular changes and also Structured Products and these things that that are being released on Wall Street large institutions can get Bitcoin leverage through other means and they don't need to go down the risk curve on altcoins to get this leverage yeah and you were talking a few a few weeks ago um in on on one of these very streams about the launch of those Bitcoin options products weren't you you know that these are relative L new so yeah I think at the time we were sort of talking about those being a positive for you know certainly for Bitcoin and maybe for the overall crypto Market because that represents another sort of area in which capital can enter the market but as you say these are products for for a specific type of investor and this is you know they're not that's not going to find it those that money is not necessarily going to find its way into alt coins exactly but it's not all doom and gloom guys because there are other considerations and it's always good to look at um this from the perspective of a few other things because this is basically like a chart from Twitter um Luca on Twitter and it's basically looking at this Bitcoin dominance thing as well and what he's showing here is that um you've got uh uh this deviation and capitulation on alts that's basically people think you seen an altcoin season starting and then you have a massive deviation in capitulation and he's comparing it to the previous cycle right to 2021 and he show in the chart in 2021 so you had the deviation in capit that went to 71% and then what happened after that you had a massive fall in Bitcoin dominance which means a massive Almighty altcoin rally that started after that cap capitulation so at least from his analysis we could potentially see it's a strike and correlation the fractal looks similar and if it plays out you know we could have an altcoin season soon although he thinks Bitcoin R dominance could still rally um and then um also guy I mean if you cross your mind back to the previous cycles and previous 2021 cycle this people people have always been saying at Peak when alins are at the peak Peak apathy people have saying there will be no Al sequencies and this is the BTC cycle and always alwayss it turns out you know in the past that that was the sign that you know when sentiment was the lowest that's when things started to turn around yeah yeah and it's something that you know those of us like like you and me Nick who who've been in for a few Cycles now it's like I mean it's easy for us to forget isn't it and I guess people who maybe this is their first cycle or maybe their second cycle you know it's we we we have such short-term memories so so often when it comes to this sort of thing it's like yeah this is it oh you know this time is different and yeah yeah I it makes me wonder Nick are we gonna be doing this show in 2029 and having this exact same conversation can we bring our same notes we just need to change the date that's it exactly the same story um I'll just be a bit grayer and yeah I think it's a situation as well and thing I wanted to point out um that uh the whole question one of the biggest arguments for oh we're not going to see an altcoin season this is another chart as well which which you guys can take a look at on the screen and come back to later I won't go through it right now which is short on time but um basically the argument that's been made guy around oh we've got such a massive uh supply of altcoins too many altcoins millions of altcoins people aren't going to want to buy altcoins now because of all this and an interesting Counterpoint I've heard about that is well look at the stock market there are thousands of penny stocks out there you don't because you have these penny stocks that are worth nothing that no one trades that no one that people aren't going to go and bid Nvidia that they aren't going to go and bid Facebook or Google or any number of Assets in the S&P 500 so just because you've got all these this plethora of excuse the word shitcoins out there right that no one's going to want to buy doesn't mean that people aren't going to go want to go and bid the top 50 or top 100 altcoins by market cap um you know it's it's just it's just a matter of and Retail is not going to want to explore oh there's a million there's 20 million coins now I have to go and study everyone I'm going to go and treat the same due diligence to the coin that just launched on pump do fund versus an investment in Salan or Su or whatever so that's an interesting cont point and I think it kind of does make sense absolutely absolutely does and yeah it's like well you know I I think to my portfolio because I've been looking at some of the alts that I hold and just like oh God I'm so you so underwater on some of these but actually the vast majority of my portfolio is is made up of assets you know even if you discount Bitcoin I mean you know almost half of my portfolio is Bitcoin but even if you discount that most of it is still in assets that are within the top 20 cryptos by market cap so you know I think it I I think for this cycle yes it's going to be it's going to be that much harder to pick out a 1000x that's going to come out of nowhere and and pump because it you know that that was easier in the last cycle when there were when there were perhaps fewer fewer coins but I think it it kind of goes back to what we were talking about a bit last week as well does is it it's like what are the what are the ones that you have the most conviction in and I think you know if if you're someone who's got you know your highest conviction is in you know an altcoin with a sort of sub five million market cap then you're either you're either extremely optimistic or you need to rethink your conviction because you know I think that some of the winners are kind of already kind of obvious in terms of you know in terms of market caps and things like that so I think that's something to bear in mind you know as and as we've always said like you know altcoins especially low caps there is a space for there is a space for them in any portfolio because obviously that is how you turn a very small amount of money into a very large amount of money but you're gonna you would have to be extremely lucky to to to to strike it you know strike it um strike a a winner on you know on even one or two so it's that's why it's important to go for higher market cap ons as well more established ones some positivity on the altcoin season there will be an ALT season guys it won't be what you we expected in the past but there will be a perfect opportunity to get some very strong good players on the altcoin space and speaking of which if you are thinking about picking up some altcoins well I couldn't think of a better place to do that than uh binance so shout out to our brand our brand partner um binance we've got a deal going on there where you can get um signing up with a link below you can get an exclusive 20% trading fee discount for life and a $600 bonus and um what once you've your crypto your altcoin you of course you'll want to secure it on one of the best hardware wallets out there Ledger and uh they've also got a giveaway of $10 $10 in Bitcoin um in a redeemable card that you can get after you've Port your device um The Ledger flex and stacks we've got a few of these already they're great products and guy we met last week we met the um the CTO and cxo of Ledger right yeah yeah really smart that was a great confers that's one of those ones you just like I could happily sit here all evening that was on Thursday so I had to go off and do NFA but yeah we had a really good chat with those guys they are working on a lot of interesting stuff there at ledger so and especially stuff around you know making crypto's ux making it easier for people to interact with crypto in in a safe way so you know i' I've been banging that drum for a long time that that's so important so um yeah it's h good things good things coming from them keep an eye out for any announcements because they're going to be at the conference circuit so there'll be a lot of exciting announcements coming from leer absolutely time for the top gainers guys okay uh this is an interesting one uh some interesting top gainers so this is um the uh this is the top performing altcoins from the top 100 uh from last week first up um Bensel I don't I can't recall if tower has figured in the top gainers list doing this um so Nick are you ready to are you ready to hear why to has had such a good week I'm I'm dying T guy I know you are I know you are this is because um so this is because the dynamic towel proposal recently passed uh what is dynamic tower I hear you as you can imagine with all things potential this is extremely complex so I've been trying to make sense of this for a while Dynamic tow as I understand eliminates centralized root validators um they were the ones that used to judge the value of subnets thank God I mean because those those root validators centralized root validators I mean it's been the biggest problem plag in the crypto for a long time and how can you adequately judge these these subnet values guy I mean that's that's like the golden absolutely that is the golden snitch of crypto so yeah instead subnet value is going to be determined by the amount of tower staked in their liquidity Pools by users um there are 50 plus bensur bensur subnets um and now each one has its own deta token paired with TOA in decentralized liquidity pools obviously there is a heck of a lot more to it than that but it seems like um you know it had a community vote for this uh and that has energized the potential Bulls one of whom is Barry silbert do you remember Barry silbert silbert yes the name Rings Bell of course yes Barry is a t Boro that's crazy man what a world we live in absolutely absolutely so Barry silbert of digital currency group once arguably one of crypto's main characters obviously digital currency group did not have a very good 2024 um so has sort of you don't hear very much I mean you never used to hear that much from Barry anyway but um yeah he is uh he is long long tow okay what's next Nick next is Litecoin LTC now this is interesting um guy do you know that Canary Capital has filed for a um ETF and that Litecoin the odds of a Litecoin ETF according to poly Market are at least 81% to be approved this year and I've heard the Bloomberg ETF guys well say that that the most likely ETF to be approved will be Litecoin okay yeah okay so people are front running front running that by buying LTC over the last week or so and the Litecoin intern has up there the Twitter game considerably it's yes litecoin's Twitter page has gone from something uh Savage there we go man oh dear this intern is single-handedly controlling you single hand div developing the road mapap for Litecoin on a tweet by tweet basis beautiful do you think it's like Charlie Lee's young cousin or something like that has just uh has just taken over um yeah Taylor Swift did not have a good Super Bowl did you um okay so that is uh that is Litecoin still doing it after all these years um good to see uh good to see a granddaddy outperforming uh next up um you won't be at all surprised to hear that the uh another another week as a top performer uh this is Mantra and om um I think now I'm pretty sure this is mantra's third third consecutive appearance in the top gainers I think that's a record a few months ago you remember when sui was having that absolute run I think sui figured three times on the spin yeah um but Mantra has if not beaten that record then certainly equaled it um to be fair though guy um it is quite misleading to the extent that many people would think about oh it's been featured three times in the games of the week it must mean it's been up and to the right but no it's because crypto has chopped so much it's like rally fall rally fall so it's always like Mantra is the one that high to play on the altcoin space so it's like always rallying a bit more um because it's obviously in that rwa space right and people are very bullish on rwa um speaking of which we've got a video on rwa coming out in two days so if you're not subscribed yet do so right now yeah I think we talk about Mantra in that don't we um yeah so Mantra perhaps om not so much a top Gainer as one of the most resilient uh coins out there this week um now Nick are you sitting down because there um okay you yes you are sitting down um next on our top gainers list now just is is eos but but but guy this makes sense but because they have didn't you hear about the EOS conference going on right now in Thailand all three there oh wow okay so they've they've they've put yeah exactly they're having a coffee at they discussing the future Road EOS wow well you know they say every dog has its day um and uh never was never was a true word spoken eos's case good it just it just won't die will it speaking of dog has its day Cosmos man atam wow that's surprising that's a top Gainer yeah yeah um atam itself has yeah has has severely underperformed but it is worth pointing out Nick um that some of the coolest projects in crypto are in the cosmos ecosystem now this doesn't uh this doesn't necessarily ref any reflect any real value back to atom and this is one of Co cosmos's big problems um but Mantra that we've just talked about is a cosmos project um obviously over the last week or so we had the launch of bar chain which is Cosmos as well um so there is like lots of cool and interesting stuff happening in that uh in that ecosystem but yeah I must say I was I was a little bit surprised to see uh atom outperform um but uh yeah there we go good news for atom holders there we go right time for tweets for the week tweets of the week yes uh great so first tweet guys this is from this is from Tom stport Tom boys I finally made wife changing money my wife found out how much we are down and left me wife changing meaning wife changing you here we go yeah wife changing money uh next week guys this larious so this is basically unusual ways is B basically saying this guy um Michael Collins is a US Representative guy um in the US House I think and uh he he just disclosed buying 11 15K in eth and 30k in Virtual and he sold virtual 9 days later after being down and estimated 38% and of course he bought numerous other crypto over the last three months and rep representative Mike Collins himself on his government official Twitter account responds in the trenches one of us one of us extraordinary extraordinary I I I love how I I love the idea of this guy just in his in his office in Congress just scrolling through crypto Twitter and just absorbing the job don't care about this fil man I can't sit into this hearing who gives a [ __ ] about this I'm just going to go and [ __ ] post on Twitter DJ jump in the Discord server guys what are we aping today what's the ca send the ca God like you know this would have been hard to imagine just uh you know just a couple of years ago um someone on Capitol Hill uh speaking speaking our language so yeah another posim we're living in ass simulation and speaking of living in simulations the next week don't this happened today guys so the president of the central AF African Republic launched a mean coin on pump do fund Salon to support National digital development I mean as I thought we saw it all man you know yeah I basically said to myself I always knew that I said to myself I always knew that cryptocurrency would change the trajectory of Africa and um help monetary systems there I didn't necessarily expect a president to launch a mcoin on pump do fun but this is the reality we live in yeah yeah I mean and it's it's interesting it's the Central African Republic because do you remember they were sort of the second Nation after El Salvador to sort of adopt Bitcoin and they sort of adopted it as it wasn't quite the same sort of um uh level as El Salvador did but they sort of got in on that and then I think they kind of dropped it and stuff to be fair to be fair I have heard I mean a bit of a tangent but I've heard from I've spoken to people who have been involved to some degree with um officials at the C and they were looking at ways of potentially tokenizing minerals or Bitcoin retri Reserve so it seems that they shoved all those plans if this is true because apparently there's rumors it could be uh deep fake which to be honest the fact that we think it's more likely to be true than not based on a defect shows the state of we're in the cycle we're in but um yeah apparently they had been thinking about it before and he thought well why would he go and digit tokenize assets this just going and launch a meme mad mad predictably enough it is down bad last time I looked anyhow um so this one from uh this one from from Kobe um now Kobe is OB obviously uh crypto OG he's also recently set up this echo. XYZ which is a sort of kind of I guess a sort of crowdfunding platform um for crypto projects you know gives sort of a syndication of Syndicate deals basically get um go and get kyc and verified um and these vaults that you can participate in these deals um so yeah and then lots of projects have been using them um but the tldr what he's saying here is basically that the token teams are basically in shows you guys there's not just nefarious activity taking place among mecoin DJ on Twitter but also with projects if you buy $5 million of our token we will send you another 5 million so you get a 50% discount overall on the buy as long as you hold for end days so basically trying to create artificial demand at tge which inflates the price for the Future Foundation sales which could come basically to for liquidity for the founders and the team um so it's like low float high fdv on steroids sad State of Affairs really sad to see yeah I I kind of feel that this is part of Gary gendler's Legacy in a way like this is Market manipulation isn't it and this is this is the state of this is the state of the market this is what happens when you don't get clear regulations when you don't get you know uh a set of a set of regulations a set of rules that you can operate in this is the kind of behavior that that that that flourishes and yeah it's um yeah the sooner we see the back of this kind of crap the better um but yeah next week we are and then from a friend of the channel Ben khah yeah uh Ben has obviously been talking about Bitcoin dominance uh a lot and he has been proven right um but yeah the reason why sentiment in the crypto verse is so bad despite Bitcoin being around 100K is because the entire space has turned into influencers grifting meme coins and acting like they are the next Warren Buffett true that Ben the next Warren Buffett Shing Shilling their Buffet of shitcoins um yes there we go yes coins to watch guys coins to watch this week we've only got one coin to watch and this is Jupiter now this is interesting because Jupiter's hadit quite a crazy run over the past two weeks I mean maybe not to much in price but in terms of developments and also like growth of the ecosystem because they purchased moonshot another project as well um the fees were insane they went through Jupiter um and then catberry Caston bull sorry um and you know now they've got a lot of announcements coming this week um and um people are excited also updates on the buyback Etc and potentially price cretive so keep an eye on that and we've also got a uh Jupiter review coming this week uh on the main channel so keep your eyes peel for that guys um so it's just and then some unlocks to watch as well now this one's really interesting guy because today is an unlock of bar chain 12% of circular and Supply in an airdrop now in Cas you guys haven't seen the price of bar since it's launch last week which was one of the most anticipated launches of this year the biggest hyped launch um it's yeah and I think that they've been sellling prior to this now this is part of the airdrop campaign but yeah I mean guys it's it wasn't there was a lot of negative sentiment around this project launch when they launched last week right a lot of negative sentiment and I feel it's I feel it's a bit unfair in in many ways because obviously you know this the bar chain launch was was talked about for a long time they obviously wanted to try and launch when the market was was doing well um time was against them in in that regard and I think because the market was so bad you know that kind of Amplified a lot of the hate that people were feeling towards I mean okay you know there are some there are some valid criticisms a lot of people saying oh great another L1 you know another high performant L1 or whatever it's like yeah you know there certainly you know there there are reasons to there are reasons to question it but I feel it was a little bit unlucky but um yeah having a big unlock like that so soon after the airdrop which predictably of course the air drop itself predictably uh pissed a lot of people off as these things tend to do um so yeah it's it's not great for for barer at the moment yeah I mean to be honest I think it's Market sentiment in general right they're just they're just seen as like the easy Target because they're a launch right now and they were shorted the hell out of them and there were some other takes that I'd seen but you know it's just a difficult Market environment to launch right now which doesn't bode well for the other big ones to watch out for monad and Mega E they're probably watching that they're probably thinking don't want to get beat right now but um huh Q2 maybe launching Q2 push push back to Q2 let's push that back let's push that back keep going towards the trenches or next cycle if you don't if there is no um there's also another sand quickly there's another unlock for the sand box um sand now this one's also quite sizable to pull up the unlocks there guys again um this is uh this one's but it's about uh 8% but it's also going to it's not an airdrop component it's going to advisor and team as well potentially some cell pressure that's that metaverse one from last cycle guy so it's one of those other ones which was doing pretty well last um in the in this runup in in December actually I think in the old cycle run up um so yeah yeah dates the diary um two dates this diary as we mentioned them before um we have got on the February the 12th which is on Wednesday CPI of course this is obviously where how will drive fed policy 2.9% was the previous they're expecting 2.8% which is potentially a cooling um I've seen some commentary that we could potentially see a cooling which obviously would be good because that means that more likely than not the FED is going to want to cut uh so that's an important date to note and then on day after that we've got the PPI so you know the producer price inflation 0.2 versus what we get 0.3 expected lots lots of delicious inflation data for those those people who like that sort of thing um okay let's have a look through uh let's have a look through what people have been saying in the comments um yeah people pretty resilient actually I was expecting slightly worse sentiment across the board today but our commenters have not let us down poor old Gene Francis is still stuck in bloody Swindon um so look folks you know you may be down bad but some people are stuck in Swindon um uh Kean Liam makes a very good point patience is the most valuable asset in crypto I think I think you might be right there Kean it's yeah as we as as Nick and I were saying earlier you know we have been in this situation before you know post harving years you do get you know you do historically get this sort of price action so yeah I think if you're you know I think what a lot of people need to do is just don't try and play this just sit tight we're as we' we've mentioned so many bullish things on this stream today in terms of you know bullish developments that are either kind of happening now or they're in a pipeline for the whole crypto industry so yeah the best thing about patience is like um the best about patience is like knowledge it's free you just have to work on it yeah exactly exactly very Zen Nick very Zen um want cookies also makes a good point this is something that Ben count too has been talking about I think we need to see QE first before alts run yeah definitely this is again this is something that gets forgotten a lot we are still in a high rates environment yes we've had uh yes the FED has taken a few basis points off that uh off that um interest rate but that we you know we're still a lot higher than we were in the last Bull Run so we also got some QT going on and the tenure is still pretty high um so once the QT first needs to stop and then you know we need to see the tenure coming down and all this kind of stuff yeah yeah a good uh another good point here from BK alt season is here just changing narratives I think you were you were mentioning this ear talking about earlier weren't you Nick it's yeah rotation through narratives exactly um although yeah like and that's what we probably see going forward right um especially if we do get the M rotation into Els in general it will be rotating through different narratives and that's the point around don't huddle for life you need to obviously think about El strategically what's making sense right now and what's good absolutely just a couple of others uh random dude 45 who is very interesting thumbnail pick um interesting take salana ruined the market a Magic Poop Cannon of memco that rug pull people every other minute yes and no I I mean I kind of think it's a little bit it's a perhaps a little bit I say this is a soul holder so you know perhaps it's a little bit much to put the blame on on salana itself I mean pump. fun if you like yeah yeah but app you can't blame the app I mean you can't blame the chain for the app right um uh so yeah yeah um Mr Bill is unhappy because uh guy your cousin stole my gear um look that that's that's between you and Barry Mr Bill I can't I'm not going to intervene on that what he talking about well I I don't know I it's probably not fit to discuss on a family stream like like today's is speaking about look look like I say I don't want to get involved where Barry's concerned I don't like to get involved that guys guys off the off unhinged um and strowman asks is that a hotel room is he fleeing the country yes it is a hotel room no I'm not fleeing the country um Mr guy and I are just having a few few days away um but as I say uh as I will explain at the top of next week's stream even when you think you might have got away from crypto crypto doesn't get away from you so uh so tune in next week so you guys definitely tune in next week to hear that it was give crazy full rundown um okay that is uh that is about it for this week so Nick good to see you um I hope you're I hope you're keeping everyone back at Dubai HQ everyone's missing you guy and yeah enjoy your time whatever time you have left try not to look at the charts you know try to spend some quality time thank you thank you whatever time I have left that almost sound sounds like I'm coming to the end of my life doesn't it no um thank you very much thank you very much good to see you everyone thank you for watching tune in again next week and we will see you soon cheers guys [Music] I'm now living in a fom by the river this this PE with the next thing NE Che yeah I have more blood to be donated give me the king size fries Nick I care for the Lord don't worry being happy folks It's All a Game oh guys looking very B I am me don't worry be happy folks it's all the game oh guys looking I [Music] [Applause] [Music] am good stream guys eh you sure you stopped this time though because like last time when you we ended the

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed sentiments, with Bitcoin struggling to maintain a price above $100,000 and altcoins facing significant deleveraging. Despite these challenges, there is optimism about regulatory developments and institutional interest in Bitcoin. The market is closely watching events like the White House Crypto Summit and economic data releases for potential impacts on crypto prices.\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin Outlook:** Analysts like Tom Lee predict Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 in 2025, with some targets as high as $200,000 to $250,000. However, short-term volatility is a concern, with recent price corrections[1][3].\n\n- **Altcoin Trends:** The altcoin market has seen significant liquidations, leading to discussions about whether an \"alt season\" will occur. Sentiment is bearish, but some analysts suggest that altcoins could rally if Bitcoin dominance peaks[3][4].\n\n- **Institutional Interest:** There is growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, with products like ETFs allowing for more capital to flow into the market. This has led to a divergence in capital entering Bitcoin versus altcoins[4].\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Predictions:** Some analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $170,000 to $185,000 by the end of 2025, while others suggest a potential drop to $73,000 before a significant rally[3].\n\n- **Risk Warnings:** The market is cautious due to regulatory uncertainties and the potential for further liquidations. The Nasdaq's double top breakdown also poses risks for Bitcoin's long-term trend[5].\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Diversification:** Investors are advised to consider diversifying their portfolios, focusing on established cryptocurrencies and keeping an eye on regulatory developments.\n\n- **Patience:** Given the current volatility, patience is recommended. Investors should monitor market trends and regulatory updates before making significant moves.\n\n- **Risk Management:** It's crucial to manage risk, especially with leverage trading, as liquidations can significantly impact market prices.\n\n## Coins Mentioned\n\n- **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n- **Litecoin (LTC)**\n- **Ethereum (ETH)**\n- **Mantra (OM)**\n- **EOS**\n- **Cosmos (ATOM)**\n- **Jupiter**\n- **Bar Chain**\n- **The Sandbox (SAND)**\n\n## Regulatory Developments\n\n- The White House Crypto Summit and potential legislation are key events that could shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S.\n- There is a push for clearer regulations, particularly around stablecoins, which could unlock innovation and provide clarity for the broader crypto industry[4].",

    "transcript": "in this video i'm gonna give you a list of coins that are easy 20 50 and even 100 x's without any hyperbole without any exaggeration this isn't some hype oh my god moonshot video this is likely going to happen if this situation occurs and you just show up on these dates i'm going to talk about right now now look i realize that sounds insane because if if you checked your portfolio lately crypto's not doing so hot the word cardano is actually synonymous with the word hobo however i truly believe right now there's never been an easier time in the last i don't know five years to four or five even six sex your net worth quite easily without too much risk before you light your pants on fire and smash your dick and anger there's context give me a second provide it but i believe it's the easiest time to do that and if you can be patient you can be patient keyword patient young padawan you can find these coins that are going to do these 20x 50x's 100 x's if you can be patient and wait for me to give you context before flaming this video with angry comments or pooping in your hand and throwing it at the wall like an angry chimpanzee calm down give me a second to explain i realize being bullish at this point in time is enough to trigger twitter guys who are 30 years old to put on black emo makeup and scream at their mother for not giving them enough allowance but but you need to look at it this way where the markets are right now there's a lot of opportunities to make nice clean four or five x's without doing anything too crazy but if you dig down like we're going to do in this video and look at this one industry in this one niche and you pay attention these dates you pay attention to these markers there's a very good opportunity coming up here to buy some few coins that can do outlandish returns you can place some very very very good bets here very soon and the cool thing about this video is i'm telling you early and you don't have to take action right now you just have to look for it the problem is if you don't know when to look for it or where to look for it what's going to happen is everybody's going to be there when this actually happens now you can actually plan and be there before everybody else instead of buying bitcoin at 64k and telling everyone at thanksgiving so without further ado let me break down what's going on the market right now and give you some general things i'm seeing that the easy four to five x's then we're gonna dive into the dirty stuff if you wanna see stuff i'm getting into particularly this dirty stuff as it happens i can't always make a video because i actually run a software company as my grown-up adult job but i will be posting this stuff on twitter when i see it happening when i think it's time to be looking at it so you should follow me at cssbecker on twitter so let me get into it now look guys like always i have to do my blow effort reading of coin market cap to tell you where bitcoin in the market is the the low quality effort rambles of this channel it's a key it's pristine aspect of why you come here so let's just get into it jokes aside it's very important we understand where the market is right now what's going on what's going to happen in the next five years and then look at the top coins because that's going to tell us where we're going to actually go and do pretty well in the smaller coins and the things i'm going to talk about here to get those dank returns but again the dankness the 5 a.m gains they're based around bitcoin they're based around the top coins so first thing i'd really like you to do if you're new here is i'd like you to go back and watch my last video that gives you context on this entire market because i don't have time to repeat that rant in this video long story short the entire video is everybody was screaming the bye right here we are down a lot right here okay the highest risk time in the market the buy was right here the lowest risk time in the market to buy was right here and so the first thing you have to ask yourself is this is crypto going to come back are we ever going to return and surpass old all-time highs or is crypto dead that's really the only two questions got to ask yourself is it coming back or is it dead if it is coming back and is going to surpass old all-time highs then anything you buy right now particularly in the top 10 coins that are good coins is going to make you an easy three four five x return over five years that is ridiculous if you put in ten thousand dollars right now in the bitcoin in five years if crypto comes back if crypto comes back keyword if this is not financial advice there is a chance here just get an absolutely phenomenal return you put in ten thousand dollars you put an x amount of dollars if you can do math you five exit am i saying i'm gonna put my entire net worth in bitcoin and ethereum no but this if if crypto dies if you think crypto's gonna die you have no business watching this channel like why would you come here if you think crypto has no future and it's not gonna exist anymore you're just sitting here to punch your dick in anger which is weird but i mean reply guys gotta get off somehow because they're not getting laid so that being said if you are here because you're interested in crypto then like myself you believe it's coming back and so looking at the top 10 coins right now is bitcoin going to go lower are we going to crash further sure we could there's a bunch of things that could happen we could see a lot more exchanges get liquidated uh we could see voyager and other storage places of crypto banks go down we could see tether get attacked and go down just like luna did there's there's no reason if those things happen bitcoin couldn't go to five thousand three thousand dollars the key question is are we going back to old all-time highs in the future or is this was this last run just the peak of all crypto i don't think it was so if we buy here and it goes lower that is fine because we're not buying up here like all the hooligans that bought it 67 000 buying up here was the most risky time this is when people should have been screaming no don't buy you're an idiot now people are screaming no don't buy you're an idiot down here i believe we're going back here someday so the ability to 5x my money is pretty cool so the biggest risk to you right now if you are investing in crypto is not so much that you're going to lose money again you're probably gonna have to wait a very very long time for us to go back to this old all-time high if you bought up here and you're holding right here you're stupid i can't help you stop doing stupid things in the future maybe i don't i don't know but if we're buying down here you're probably not going to have to wait forever to break even and start making on your money we could go lower it could be a year it could be two years but i've done the math i'll explain to you by now if you don't get it i'll have a special boy session where i draw it out in purple crown and break it down using cookies and oreos for you so your biggest risk right now when you buy something is the fact that it might not come back next market that's the big risk now is bitcoin probably going to be here next market yes maybe if tether gets wiped out bitcoin get flipped something could happen right there if we're looking at the lowest risk thing that's going to come back next market is bitcoin is ethereum going to be here next market i think ethereum 2.0 is going to get launched i think vitalik's a really smart guy ethereum looks good i think we're going to go back to old hall time highs on ethereum someday maybe not next month you're gonna have to wait all right if this is the money you're using to pay your rent or or your dad loans you so you can take your girlfriend the six flags maybe don't invest it right here but if you have some money saved up that you're not going to use in the next five years if you've been a responsible adult with your finances maybe maybe it's time to consider barking it somewhere so looking at theorem right here if it goes to 4 500 awesome so once we get past bitcoin and ethereum we get into a little bit more of a speculative zone because xrp cardano solana dot we can just keep going on the totem pole polygon the things that i like these could go either way now is that me saying they're dead and they suck all right cardano holders i know it sucks living with your girlfriend's boyfriend asking to use the internet so you can watch my videos get mad and then go jerk off with tweezers because that's the only way you can touch yourself but even you will have your day in the sun trust me cardano's getting pretty low right here too and so i'm not here to bash any things or remind people that i i told them to sell certain coins at two dollars and 80 cents and they made fun of me and then they held it and now it's at 46 cents i'm not here to remind them of what a financial devastating loss it is i'm not here to do that okay i'm not here to remind people that they had to look their girlfriend the eye and say they can't make the netflix build this month i'm not here to do that i'm not here to do that okay so with that in mind looking at these coins some of them might not come back now if we look at a lot of them there's there's cases where xrp will be here next year i think bmb is going to be here because it's a phenomenally well ran company it's probably the best rand company that actually makes money in crypto in my opinion cardano there are a lot of technology technological advantages behind cardano charles might know what he's doing i don't really know but if everything they say is true cardano could have a really big place in the future of ecosystems when it comes to layer ones solana i really like solana because i use it a lot i think it is probably the most approachable realistic blockchain to use for applications for the masses right now salon has a lot of problems too and so if you look at these coins right here you're going to get much larger returns on these cardana you could easily see a 10x solana if it goes back to all-time highs or above i really like salon at this point in time but it's more speculative you have to understand that and i could see salon easily going to 500 next bull run we peaked out at about 250 dollars i could see double that or at least 300 so we could get a nice clean x on solana however here is where context starts coming in if you see reply guys screaming that alex is saying buy solana before it crashes they make at this point in the video that's why they lost all their money at 67k because they don't listen you have to understand at this point in time what i'm doing is i'm very cool dollar cost averaging in the bitcoin and ethereum okay because in my opinion which could be very incorrect we're looking at the long term here all right the long-term prices of bitcoin sixty thousand hundred thousand forty five hundred dollars at least if at least if we go back to all-time highs if we look at these two right here i'm very confident they're coming back and where they're going to so i'm cool dollar cost averaging into this if you don't know what dollar cost averaging is i don't know why you're investing in things stop it but i'm cool dollar cost averaging in that and that means investing small amounts of money over time as this bear awareness continues i think we're going much slower on these things now when we go into these lower coins right here here's where it gets more dangerous because the higher the market cap of coins the less likely they're going to fall sort of sort of that's a gist of it okay so i could see bitcoin dropping another 30 50 percent i could see ethereum dropping another 30 60 percent i can see solana and these other coins dropping way more okay and then they might not come back next bull run so we're dealing with a lot more risk with these coins so frankly what i am doing is i'm waiting until solana goes and enters the 30 to 20 range last time this happened i bought a bunch of it i bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was at 17k ethereum when it dipped down down as well i bought that those times not because i'm doing some sniping calling the bottom crap just because i'm dca into them now the good prices for salon on these coins is probably around a twenty to thirty dollar solana okay could it go lower than 20 yes it could but those losses at that point are somewhat sustainable and acceptable compared to the long-term rewards okay a 20 solanum back to its old-time high is a substantial return and so those are the coins i'm looking at in particular i'm looking at solana i'm looking at xrp even though it will blow people's minds i'm looking at b and b i'm looking at polygon i'm looking at uni swap because i think next blower and decentralized exchanges are going to be way more powerful than they are right now and i'm also looking at chain link big time i'm also looking at cosmos because it's it's an incredible technology and i'm also looking at dot because i think the next bull run we're gonna have a lot of interconnected chains i think that's going to be the perks of those things now there's so many coins i can dig into down here they're great okay there's a lot of coins i like there's a lot of coins that might be cool but here's the next thing you need to understand my friends this is the most important part of this video this is where we get into the dank dirty stuff so you need to understand how lower coins than the ones i described move so here's the covet crash this is when i started buying bitcoin at and so it took about uh the old bitcoin all-time high was about 17 18 000 give or take somewhere around there i don't know the exact number during this time right here if you go look at alt coins for example they didn't really move so look at this date right here november 24th okay so let's see how much solana moved in this time frame one of the top coins so let's look at all time right here all right so if we go and look at december 24th it actually lost money it wasn't doing anything okay it's like it was actually higher before this uh november 24th so when we're looking at this right here you need to understand that these all coins and these smaller coins they're not going to really start moving until we see a 50 000 bitcoin it could actually be until we see um you know 64 67 000 bitcoin if history repeats itself i think as we surpass 40 050 000 again i think that's really when you need to start going and looking at these coins right here and and so a lot of coins i mentioned if you want to play it really safe outside that top 10 that's the play to make right there there's no reason to be buying any coins below this right now they're probably going to go way lower and you don't know if they're coming back and at least if you wait till bitcoins goes and starts reclaiming its old all-time high or approaching that again you're gonna have a lot of time to do it especially around when bitcoin halves it's just that's when you want to be looking at these things again there's no reason to be buying them right now this is the context i was talking about the beginning of the video a lot of people were like oh four chords are gonna make me rich and they just go in yolo their kids allowance money into all these these coins that's not what i'm telling you to do here dude easy easy keep your pants on so what we want to be doing is researching now in my opinion there is one space that is going to deliver the absolute best returns that is going to be the gaming and metaverse space the market cap of this space right now is 10 billion i would be shocked and appalled and very weirded out if this does not approach a trillion dollars multiple trillions of dollars in the next five to ten years probably sooner probably around five years or so like that so knowing this you have to understand apple facebook tesla these these companies hit trillion dollar market caps those are those are single companies entire companies of equal sizes will be based around vr metaverse experiences augmented reality experiences kind of similar to pokemon go and stuff like that on top of that mobile phones if you go and look at mobile games for example if you look at clash of clans or just go top go into google and type in top earning mobile games you'll you'll see some guns those are some of the most profitable games ever and they tie in perfectly with crypto and it's pay or play to earn uh situation that works out in crypto gaming if you see anything like gmt stepping or whatever pay to walk we're going to see so many different things like that crop up in gaming we're going to see people owning digital land more we're going to see people owning digital advertising spaces more i'm actually building or working on another company based around this on top of that utility platforms chains products that are used to enable these technologies are going to skyrocket and so i think getting in right now is is silly it's probably going to go lower i mean you can get in right now if you want but if bitcoin goes down to ten thousand dollars these things are gonna they're gonna be so negative that you'll actually be rich you're gonna flip into a different timeline universe you're gonna get sucked into a black hole where cardano's a profitable investment and that's how bad it will get so it's not time to be looking at these right now but it will be a time by the way if you are really interested in crypto gaming and metaverse and you're really interested in this industry i am i am that's why i started an nft community called neo tokyo which is 100 based around researching building and investing in crypto gaming and may diverse opportunities for example the entire community is based around finding alpha research and getting into projects early finding the best coins to get into find the best companies to be investing in bringing those companies into our community and basically bring the leaders of those companies top influencers of gaming all into one space if that interests you you should go check it out there's a link underneath my twitter to it you can go to our website you can learn a lot more about it again i have to stress this is for builders and people that want to actually contribute to community this isn't some community where i sit around give you coin picks and are going to get rich off the floor no you're probably not going to make some quick flip buying a neo-tokyo nft what you will get is access to gaming ideos gaming nft whitelist alpha research amazed with top gaming companies there in the space first access to a lot of these projects and more importantly a community of people that are super focused in the space that are building in it and working together to be on the absolute cutting edge of it if you're going to catch anything early and you really believe in crypto gaming in the future made a verse like i do it's a good place to be you should go check out our site research it but moving on the gaming coins this is where i think the 20 to 100 x's are going to be but what you need to do is be patient here okay because i don't think it's a good idea to invest in any micro caps or mid caps right now for the exact reason i said before what you want to do is you want to start researching very heavily and wait for bitcoin to start approaching its old all-time high before you start putting your dick back in the pencil sharpener and playing a game of chicken there okay and so looking at these right now what what should we start looking at when bitcoin starts to approach that first thing you're probably going to see is sandbox or the central land starting to pump very very hard you might actually see engines starting to move but you're probably going to see these two right here sandbox is kind of like the bitcoin of crypto gaming okay so for example i told everyone it was the top of sandbox right here and then as soon as sandbox started going down the rest of crypto gaming went down so you can really use sandbox as a gauge does that mean you should invest in sandbox i don't i don't really like sandbox i'm not the biggest fan of it i i'm not that into it you could probably see some pretty decent returns on sandbox you could see a nice clean 1020x i mean if we return back to all-time highs of this thing eight dollars we could see it we could see it go back to all-time highs at eight dollars and whatnot i i think i can get that return on ethereum going back and doing a 10x i don't know if sandbox is coming up in two three years from now sandbox might not even be a thing games die off all the time and so that's just a general rule of thumb thing i just gave you right here don't just write down your book jambock bumps you're gonna go nuts and if sandbox doesn't pump just mix this whole entire trend all together but take that into mind so what i would be investing in in crypto gaming is this so there's a lot of cool games there's a lot of really cool games and there's a lot of things you should look out for there's games like elluvium there's games like treeverse there's games like meta gods there's betting and gambling apps like d-racers so much cool stuff going on in crypto gaming and i could sit here for hours listing coins that's why you should follow me on twitter because i talk about the things as they happen or come join neo tokyo where there's actually time to conversate in this stuff but i'm gonna time limit with these videos because you guys have the attention span of gnats so i need to be quick so what would i be buying in crypto gaming here's what i would be looking at i would be looking at utility or platform so what are those look at like steam or the code or apps that people are going to be using in their games okay there's going to be a lot of apps there's going to be a lot of technology that gain companies rent so for example unreal uh or unity if you launch a game with those and it's successful you have to end up actually paying them some royalties uh because you use their engine you wanna look for stuff like that and so let's let's talk about a few of these so i like looking at for example game companies like gala that are making lots of games because what happens with games you have to understand is that when games drop their life spans are very short they see their peak players one month and then most of them don't stick around if you look at fall guys for example it made so much money within a two month span and then nobody touched it anymore you know if you look at overwatch it was played for two to three years then fell off the grid you have to understand that most games get really cool and a lot of attention look at look at eldon ring for example people play the crap out of it and they're going to keep playing it but the user numbers are way down from where they were okay so you have to understand games go like this so what we want to invest in is the company making the game so gal is like an example of like blizzard or whatnot so that's how you want to think about these things or you want to look at the utility things going on so for example ultra is like the steam of crypto gaming steam is very profitable if ultra can take a shot at that there you go so it has a lot better chance of coming back because they're not relying on like a popular game right there and i think that's where a lot of people make mistakes investing in crypto gaming vulcan forge is another one that i think is absolutely excellent they're developing all sort of technology inside crypto gaming dexes tons of games there they really are just work at such a quality level that i think you should watch this and really be eyeing it when bitcoin starts going up the all-time highs there's also things like veracity that are related to streaming of video games uh streaming in general that i think that that's going to absolutely crush it because if you look at how crypto applies with streaming and how youtube works and how even ads and stuff on that work that's going to absolutely crush it i think metaverse advertising is going to be huge that's why we'll be looking at ad shares right here that that is really really cool in my book now another surefire thing you want to be looking at is going to be the launch pads okay c25 for example they're doing they're making a lot of stuff right now they're making a studio there's so many cool things they're doing but at bare minimum people are going to want to get into launch pads okay so for example neotokia has a launch pad citizen capital it's not actually part of us but it's citizenran which is our people inside of that but another really good one is cdfi and so what's going to happen when the bull run takes off again people are going to suddenly want to start investing in startups again well the way you invest in startup projects is through launch pads that makes cedify a basically no brainer in this the situation now you can also find smaller gaming launch pads as well now the other things i think are going to work really well that don't go out of style are gambling and mobile apps why because people don't care if a gambling game it doesn't gain hype and people stop playing it but people keep going and playing roulette over and over and over again same exact things that's why i like games like d-race which is just basically a horse racing game where you can bet on and own assets instead of it and whatnot altura is one of my favorite picks here and it's at a ridiculously low price so for example last bull run we bought it right here it went all the way up here we made so much money on altura that's why you should follow me on twitter you should join in tokyo you're going to see stuff like that now that being said altura is a technology that games can use for their nfts to update them so for example when you're playing world of warcraft you level up your store the image and the stats and everything change around it well that's very useful for nfts altura makes that very very easy with their stuff it plugs in and so that's why i think altura is absolutely huge now there's so many other games in here and if you've seen my other videos you know the games i like and i talk about the games i like on twitter all the time i'm just giving you some examples okay so if you had to write down a list of what to look for you want to look for utility or platforms the gaming companies okay you want to look for the technology in games what they're going to be building around kind of like i mentioned with altura you want to look for the the things they're going to be placed in games kind of like i mentioned that ad company and you want to look for maybe the layers or the the protocols they're going to be running on so engine coin is one of those runs over there and also look at other layer ones i think solana and polygon are going to have really powerful positions in crypto gaming that's why i also invest in those two whenever they get into good buying ranges so that's what i'm looking at right now that's my cheat handbook and the reason why i'm looking at these again is because this market cap right here is going to 100x that's why i think these coins especially if we start getting into them as they bottom out or bitcoin starts to replace that's why i think those will be easy 20 50 100 x's okay we did it last bull run i think we can do it again when things are going much lower now okay so that's what i'm thinking i've been talking for a long time and to be straight with you i'm tired of talking so to sum it all up that's that cardano was a bad investment at 2.80 cents follow me on twitter at css becker that's where i shout out and point out things much sooner if you're really interested in crypto gaming check out neo tokyo it's linked underneath my twitter account again it's not some get rich quick get calls and get a quick flip and make money super fast it's a community people that are really interested in video games and crypto gaming if you're some beta flipper want to get rich quick doing nothing isn't actually interested in the space person please stay away because we hate you that's all i got to say i'll see you guys next video [Music] [Music] [Music] you",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a mix of optimism and caution. Despite recent downturns, there is a belief that the market could rebound, with some predicting significant returns for investors who are patient and strategic in their investments. The current bull market, which began in November 2022, is considered mature, but there are signs of potential for long-term growth, especially with increased adoption and regulatory clarity[1].\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin and Ethereum:** These top coins are seen as stable investments for long-term growth. The speaker suggests dollar-cost averaging into these assets, anticipating significant returns if the market recovers to previous highs[Transcript].\n\n- **Altcoins:** Coins like Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Polygon are mentioned as speculative but potentially rewarding investments. Solana, in particular, is highlighted for its usability and potential for substantial returns if it reaches previous highs[Transcript].\n\n- **Gaming and Metaverse:** This sector is identified as a high-growth area, with potential for significant returns. Companies and platforms involved in gaming technology, such as Gala and Ultra, are noted for their potential[Transcript].\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Targets:** Solana is predicted to potentially reach $300 or more in the next bull run, while Sandbox could see a 10-20x return if it reaches previous highs[Transcript].\n\n- **Risk Warnings:** There is a significant risk that smaller coins may not recover if the market does not rebound. The speaker emphasizes the importance of patience and strategic investment timing[Transcript].\n\n- **Regulatory Environment:** The U.S. government's potential establishment of a crypto strategic reserve could add legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, but clear regulatory frameworks are still needed[2].\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Patience and Research:** Investors are advised to be patient and conduct thorough research before investing, especially in smaller or speculative coins[Transcript].\n\n- **Diversification:** Diversifying investments across different sectors, such as gaming and metaverse, can help manage risk and potentially capture significant returns[Transcript].\n\n- **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** This strategy is recommended for investing in top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum to mitigate market volatility[Transcript].\n\n## Cryptocurrencies Mentioned\n\n- **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n- **Ethereum (ETH)**\n- **Solana (SOL)**\n- **XRP**\n- **Cardano (ADA)**\n- **Polygon (MATIC)**\n- **Uniswap (UNI)**\n- **Chainlink (LINK)**\n- **Cosmos (ATOM)**\n- **Polkadot (DOT)**\n- **Sandbox**\n- **Ultra**\n- **Gala**\n- **Vulcan Forged**\n- **Veracity**\n- **Engine Coin**\n- **Altura**",

    "transcript": "can we still make five x's 10 x's 20 x's and crypto is there any money left yes guys there is and in this video i'm going to show you exactly where to look i'm going to show you exact coins that i'm also looking at as well starting with conservative stuff at the top of the video the more risky stuff that can get those higher returns that being said let's address elf in the room i know what you're thinking how the [ __ ] is this guy sitting here talking about making money in crypto is he had too many bomb pops because he's speaking lunacy one i really like bomb pops they're pretty good but look guys i have to get real i'm gonna drop the character not even do a crazy intro this video because look i know a lot of you guys are hurting right now and i'm not here to beat you up as you know i am the most woke empty house crypto fat advice guy with a great body who's also pg family friendly and has a six-pack and is also science yes we're that now too and i'm not here to make you guys feel bad or remind you of you know stuff like you going to thanksgiving and telling everybody how much money you have in crypto i'm not here to remind you your father probably thinks you're a failure now i'm not here to beat you up and do that stuff i'm not here to remind you that you bought cardano at three dollars i mean charles hodgson he does have great llamas and you know it's not that bad that your girlfriend's new boyfriend lives in your house and makes you wear a mask inside i'm not here to remind you about that i'm not here to remind you about you posting on facebook about the metaverse when sandbox was up 600x that was that was a logical thing to do at the time no one could have seen it coming a dip at all no one could have seen that and i'm i'm not here to remind you that bitcoin came nowhere close to 100k but it's not your fault again i'm not here to remind you that michael saylor he has a boat behind him you should totally listen to him he post exciting things about hornets why would it not go to 100k totally not your fault i'm here as you know to remind you of how to be a man in crypto and bring you in and pull that clown nose off your face you look ridiculous pick you back up and say you know what we're in a dip it's probably gonna get better it might not we might not lose all of our money but we might not and in that might not circumstance if the market comes back the projects i'm gonna be talking about in this video are going to probably explode so let's get into it as always follow me on twitter at css becker because i can't talk about really small projects on this channel because i'm way too famous and you'll get notified about things like neo-tokyo drops and stuff way sooner if you've been on that you would have made like a 10x by now you should have followed me cspecker let's go all right guys we're back in the chair front of coin market cap because we can't work the fancy ta charts we don't need those 2022 new year new expectations delivering the same disappointing content you guys are in for a treat this year because we're not changing up the thing i know what i can get away with anyways let's talk about the market it's terrible right now and what i know you guys want me to talk about because we always talk about the market beginning videos is what's going to happen next unlike every other influencer with their magic wingding ta charts i'm gonna tell you the same thing i always do i don't i don't know dude i i really don't it's very very difficult to call and predict what bitcoin does because it leads the pack and as you know the way i like to trade is waiting based on what bitcoin and the top coins do and then buy micro caps based on that that's what i do in these videos that's how i let a lot of success the last run up i don't know what it's going to do i'm waiting to see what happens and i'm going to buy accordingly i'm very much out of the market right now i told you guys at the sandbox peak that i was going to start taking really aggressive profits that's exactly what i did and the timing of that was very very very lucky that said look if you were buying bitcoin at 65 000 telling your grandmother it's time to buy avax and cardano at thanksgiving you're an apple there's there's there's nothing more to it you you're in a tough spot so i don't i don't have any condolences to really offer right there but i do want to give a little bit of feedback on what i think the market is going to do because i think there's going to be a silver lining here if there isn't i'm just going to keep my wait and see play that we talked about in the last micro cap video here's what i think is happening guys so we had a massive massive run up okay and what's happening and what everyone's terrified of is the fed increasing rates and that putting us into a somewhat of a recession okay and that's obviously going to hurt the crypto market yada could that happen yes definitely okay here's what i think needs to happen all right so everybody's terrified of one of these let's go look at the old crypto crashes where it goes up and it goes in this crater terrible place i don't really see this happening because in in this olden days back in the ye old days of baby diaper bitcoin there was really no justification for most of this stuff to exist now let's be straight there's no reason for most of it to exist right now but some of it there there is a justification crypto's gone mainstream here at this point in time you didn't see celebrities getting in you didn't see big funds buying in you didn't see major major companies buying and investing in uh crypto assets and crypto video games and nfts you didn't see a d you just didn't see that look guys we've the genie is out of the bubble in my opinion encrypted we're not at a point where we're going to go back down to these these terrible bear markets i just don't think we're going to see that again i think we can see bear markets but here's how i think we're going to see the next bear market so what we're looking at right now is everybody getting scared of the fed but in my opinion the only thing that's going to take out the crypto market is going to be a big big old recession which i think is coming i think we're we're heading towards like the great depression again something just as bad as that i think we're heading there however before that i think we're going to see one massive runoff because what's happening is everybody's taking all their money out of all the markets and like oh no is this the big dip and then when we don't actually dip and we don't actually crash and a recession doesn't start quite yet everyone's going to get drunker than they've ever gotten before i think that's what's going to happen and that thing is going to be to blow up top to all markets because what's going on right now and all markets combined retail anything really is we're in an everything bubble prices are skyrocketing on everything because people just won't stop people are racking up debt it's just it's out of control until we get a big pp slap in the entire mark and we fall into a recession i don't see it stopping that also being said crypto again it's gone mainstream i don't see it stopping right now what what is going to stop it there are so many good use cases and adaptations and ways to actually build really really super profitable businesses in crypto right now isn't like it was in 2017 so i just really don't i really don't like comparing these these ups with this up it's just it's a completely different scenario and while the the dumps are very similar i don't think we're going to see these these 80 90 dips on bitcoin in the top 10 coins okay so what do we want to do at this point okay so there's a few things we need to do first thing we need to do guys is we need to go down there's this one coin that just it hasn't been doing very well we talked about on the channel a while back i don't want to rub it in i don't like to rub this in i don't like to gloat as you guys know i'm very humble but as we know everybody in cardano's been doing really bad since we told them to sell it about three dollars so the first thing we really need to do guys on this channel is is we need to go out and we need to buy lots of ham yes yes ham why because most cardinal holders they're having to let their girlfriend's boyfriend live with them now uh because they can't pay rent and on top of having to wear a mask in the house the the new boyfriend is obviously eating all the ham if you've ever seen cardinal holders they're just grumpy everywhere they look like they don't have enough ham give them some fam maybe give them some cheese to put on top of it the guys are hungry they're people too let them have some ham because their girlfriend's boyfriend is not letting them have any ham so guys first thing we need to do like i said we need to go to the store right now guys buy these guys some ham because they're not eating right now all right they're just sitting in the corner at their house uh playing animal crossing and at least feeling rich in an imaginary world it's it's okay i mean they're probably massively in debt to the tom nook too because these people can't manage money so please donate some ham now let's talk about the other coins guys what's going to be in the marketplace the animal crossing won that that got me sorry i i'm yes i'm laughing at my own jokes and sunglasses in a dark room it doesn't get much lower than this so look how can we make money here guys so i'm gonna go through a big list of coins but let's talk about how i made a ton ton ton of money in the last run-up okay and i think we're getting right around there all right so as you guys know in the last video i waited and of course i totally called bitcoin wrong that's what i do it's kind of like my channel's attraction the one influencer that calls bitcoin wrong they all get it right but i thought bitcoin was going a lot lower about right here all right and it didn't and that's fine because i saw this big run up right here and this signal to me that the market cycle was resetting okay especially around like right here and about right here when we had a really confirmed bounce like the market was horny that's when all the micro cap coins and the coins that we're going to be talking about in this video really started to start pumping so for example cdfi was one of the things we got into we got in like 85 cents it went all the way to 15 uh this last cycle and you can see shortly after the bitcoin bump that's when all these micro caps start bumping this is the same story for every micro cap and even things that aren't micro caps like ones that have a range of 500 to a billion dollars we really start to see everything starting to pump after bitcoin now look if you bought right here you made an okay return if you bought right here you made a return we don't want to be buying it even when things are okay we wouldn't be buying when things are terrible okay so i'm not telling you to buy right now and personally this isn't financial advice in any way shape or form like i said the start of the video this is just my personal thoughts if i was being conservative right now i'd wait for it to go lower it might not what i feel is happening right now with bitcoin is the same exact thing we saw right here okay because i everyone's getting super bearish i'm getting comically bearish and you know everybody thinks 32 000 or something's on the table right now i think 38 000 on the table so that really means it's probably going to sweep like 39 000 and then start going up again i think that's about what's going to happen this reminds me of this dump right here so much again if you're being conservative i would wait i would wait for a concert confirmed bitcoin uprising okay if you want to catch the things this is the difference in the roi you're gonna get right here if you want to catch the things when they're right here versus right here which is about 50 higher or 100 higher actually you get in right now you get in when things are really bad if you want to really make good bucks you need to wait and be a little bit fast in the trigger after bitcoin starts pumping if you want to make okay buck bucks wait for a strong confirmation okay if we buy right here there's no guarantee that bitcoin doesn't just go down to 20k because it is a useless piece of [ __ ] um and that's what useless pizza should do so let's talk about coins so where do we need to be looking in this next run-up if i think the best return safe coin if we can call crypto safe is going to be solana okay if you are a if you are a guy that likes to speed in your mother's minivan over five miles per hour that makes you upset you wear your mask in the van while you're driving around salon is probably for you that's probably about as greasy and dirty as you need to be getting okay now going on down the coins that i'm looking at it's the same coins i've always been looking at guys but i think this is a really great buy position for these coins because like look all right so avex like right here not awesome like we're this there wasn't really a good buy opportunity like in any of these points right here these were not good buy opportunities but if we go back about when bitcoin started the pump october plenty of time to get a really really like you had plenty of time to get a great deal on abex okay and it's just it's just up it's just really up we're all aware of that we're all wherever it's been people are really interested in avex like really really interested in it if we go a little bit lower yeah it's going to go a little bit lower we get that confirmed reset or this might even happen before the reset that's the hard thing about these these top 25 coins is they can reset before bitcoin does they can actually help start the bitcoin reset so they're really hard to call you just have to hold them which is what i'm doing with avax and a few other coins i'm going to talk about that being said we're getting an opportunity right now where it's really cooled off and we can finally get in probably at a good price i do see a 300 avex if the cycle continues okay this is not me posting 300 on the wall where everybody posts on twitter and yeah it's around this three hundred dollars if the market cycle goes outrageous like i talked about i think a 300 avex is is completely doable on the table now zk roll ups are going to be really really big why because elliot he's just he's just talking about him a whole lot all right when elliot starts talking about stuff people get really excited they get fully erect and then he combines it with actually knowing what he's talking about and so everybody just goes and bangs the biggest trend all at once it's gross i was there for gaming crypto yeah that being said polygon it really ties in that narrative super well it's leading that eth is going to keep going he desperately needs polygon polygon is another one i think is going to do just super duper well now if we're getting down to some funny money ones if we really want to make a lot of money i'm really thinking that phantom is going to pull an avax okay it's going to go back up to the market cap that avax is at right now i think abax is going to go right under the solana market cap uh when it was pumped up and i am looking at dot ecosystem stuff but i mean dot just it just hasn't been playing that game it's been it's been [ __ ] its dick in and out of the refrigerator all year long i'm tired of it eat the ham or don't eat the ham this is a very ham themed episode if you can't tell so what else is on the table those are my kind of safer picks i think cosmos is going to do very well just because of the narrative as you guys know i just read people on how the market's going people are really really interested in cosmos and i think luna is also a fantastic buy as well those are my those are my you can you can talk about them with dinner without your father taking off the belt and beating you kind of coins okay this this is the stuff that you can talk about in church and no one's going to make you eat ham and that's your cardano holder then you're gonna be talking about in church all non-stop because you need that ham you're a hammy boy put your mask back on all right so let's talk about the more degenerate stuff guys so if we're talking about mid-level degeneracy i really just have two really good mid-level degenerate coins remark gonna be huge on the kusama network slash dot narrative huge made averse play i think this i think this sucker is going to 150 bucks and that's just what it is look into it you guys know i'm really in the maid verse and everything's being built there remark is a very very big play i think it's two really cool things another one moon river i still got good feelings about moon river it's back right at where i bought it at and why didn't i sell it with these with these higher market cap coins at the 500 million marks i'm really not looking to flip and dip these things okay because the best they're going to do is five six x's so you really just gotta sit back and hold i think if we get a strong market moon river's gonna do stupid things okay because i think dot's going to take off here eventually someday all right and because i believe in dot and what they're doing over there i think moon river and remark are really really good plays and i think this has a really good chance to pull phantom aka go to maybe a two to five billion dollar market cap i think it has such a good chance to do that um so i understand what i'm trying to do with these coins because i talk a lot about selling on these channels and so of course i've held a backs i've pulled i've held phantom all the way through a 50 dip hold it right back to where it is right now i just don't really try i just don't really try and trade these coins okay i'll sell these coins when i think we're at the market top i just don't think we're at the market top and if we're not well i don't know what to tell you it's going to suck i'm not going to be like one person like well just hold till next time no no i'm not going to be thrilled about holding in diamond handing you you do technically lose lots of money uh even if you don't sell so that's what i think and that's why i'm holding them i'm just holding these until they get to where i want them to go it's not really these are not short-term trades now let's talk about the dank stuff what i like to dabble in where i make the bucks the things i use to pay for baby corgis like scoot it's a pricey dog you gotta you gotta make the big bucks to own a scoot but seriously let's get into it also real quick shameless shill i'm gonna throw in do you know dino tokyo is hosting the largest nft gaming tournament of all time all time partnered with twitch and g fuel and animoka brands did you know we're doing that in like on the 22nd if not you should tune in because you can run play on it live on twitch we're giving away a million dollars in prizes or you can just watch people fight for a million dollars for our entertainment it's going to be super duper cool you should attend we're going to be giving away the first hand of the citadel nft for neo tokyo it is overall going to be amusing and it doesn't cost you a dime to watch so put put on your diaper cover your ham and some cheese if you're cardona holder tell your girlfriend's boyfriend it is your turn to use the computer to watch this tournament all right let's get back to it so let's have a quick pow-wow because this is really interesting to me and you need to be looking at in this way in my opinion i don't care if we go bare okay i do like the i'm not going to be looking at my ten dollar moon river and be like yeah well you know the tech is great i i i do care if we go bare but where my primary focus is in crypto and where i've made all my money lots and lots of it like 85 of it and where i'm going to make all my money is going to be gaming crypto i work in the space i also work in nfts very heavily there is nothing that's going to stop gaming crypto or nfts this year why okay bitcoin if you look at the top 25 coins they're speculative no one's using like you don't go to bank in america and you have an ethereum machine there where they're like transferring stuff in ethereum it's not being used except to trade things it's just not there are some uses for all these things there's some examples but we're not we're not seeing it mainstream you're not you're not seeing checkout or checking stations at events uh being worked through through crypto you're not seeing you're not seeing it being used it's all speculative nfts have a use case right now and they have a value that is rock solid vanity and luxury when we're talking about the jpegs nfts with other stuff that's coming in the future contracts real estate deals that's gonna be even bigger but right now it is a rock solid foundation reality people buy nfts just like they do a rolex people hold their rolexes they don't panic sell their rolexes can you imagine a person worth five million dollars panic selling their rolex because the crypto market's down they're not going to do that that's what's happening with board apes that's what happened with all their nfts and those ties super deeply into crypto games gaming desperately needs cryptocurrency to run off right now and it also def desperately needs nfts so people can own assets in space i know normal gaming environment doesn't like that it doesn't matter it's going to come whether they like it or not it's too damn it's too damn alluring for the player it just is so this year we're already seeing crypto gaming taking off actually already has player bases we're seeing other games with player bases we're seeing nfts with a rock solid foundation in their first use case which is vanity luxury and waving your dick around virtually and their second use case is going to be digital ownership of assets like for example real estate if you own a big plot of land and sandbox a lot of people play that you can put a billboard there with with a picture of me on it you should do that and that space right there will be worth a lot of money because people see it every single day it's the same basis of putting ads on websites virtual real estate it's just a different type of virtual real estate same exact thing that's what nfts are going to do so those three use cases aren't slowing down anywhere so i'm heavily focused on those investing them and they're all in the dumpster right now and they are going to come back or everyone's going to make fun of me so let's make these predictions because everybody loves these so what are we seeing in the space right now as far as games go sand is super down axis super down everything's super down if you ever want to buy sand it's still way up all right i'm not buying sand right now okay i'm i'm waiting i'm waiting to see what bitcoin does and again with all these that i'm about to talk about wait to see what bitcoin does that being said follow me on twitter at css becker i routinely post big list of coins and what you need to be doing right now is you need to have a list of coins of projects you like please watch my micro cap trading video before this and create your own list of coins okay however you need to be not buying these coins right now but watching bitcoin and then sitting and watching these a few of these won't pump when bitcoin starts to pump and you can go and grab them up i'm not saying use this list i'm saying make your own damn list and use my logic i'm going to share with you in this video all right you lost all your money once don't do it again learn learn your trade this time okay that that's exactly what happened to me in the first big crash earlier this year i was going off other people's recommendations and i sat back and actually learned my trade that i'm trying to make money with everything go up for bid i made money do the same thing here all right so again if you want ideas and stuff to look at there's a lot of cool stuff going on right here so that being said when i'm when i'm working with these i want to see good 50 x's because i know the gaming market i know to pick games when they're very very low okay if you're trying to play it safe and you just really been in gaming you really can't go wrong with sandbox gala you can't go wrong with engine axes even super duper low right now you can just really pick the top ones all right i would go with gallon sandbox personally i'd also go with alluvium that's probably going to pump super duper hard and so those are going to the higher tiers okay ufo is also probably going to come charging back like a a mana core it just probably will because it has a lot of followers has a lot of attention really good marketing they just run they just run a really tight ship over there so where is where the goofy money the fast moving going to come from let's talk about these smaller ones down here all right i think vulcan forge is going to do an absolute super duper turn around right here and i'll talk about why okay first off yes this is my biggest bag that i still have in gaming crypto so let's do a whole feature case on it and hope people uh take interest i'm just kidding all right let's talk about this for real so vulcan forged just got hacked up here someone took tons and tons and tons of the money that's shame on them thing you need to realize is they're the same company as when the coin was up here all right the coin price really doesn't matter as far as the company goes imagine what people think of the company and the risk to holding the coin they fixed the problem or if they if they're they're still having it they're very very very close to fixing it i'm not saying come pick this dude up right here i'm saying this is probably going to go back up to 60 70 bucks if it does make a recovery i'm really confident the project which is why i haven't sold when it got hacked i'm like all right look i've been through this with paid network i went through this with d-race every single time things get hacked it's just an amazing opportunity to make a lot of money if you go look at like for example paid network way back in wherever the f this was got hacked right here nuclear nuclear fallout did terrible and then bam just right back up you would have done very well and then uh this didn't look great forge has a lot of users coming online they're coming to building a whole lot of things decks games i i really like that one i think cdfi is going right back up to 15 minus the larna is really under the radar in my opinion there is tons and tons and tons and tons of players playing it all right as soon as it gets picked up i think mines of the alarm has a strong chance to pull a mini axi okay the other one i'm really looking at and i lost a lot of money in recently but i'm still holding is going to be thetan arena and i don't know where that is right here okay and the whole basis of these ones that i just mentioned is going to be the fact that they have millions of players coming on like people are actively using these games it's a matter of time before they pull the same exact thing axi did which is where the coin starts being in demand so much from the user base that starts to pump really hard okay so that's what i'm looking for in those and i think those ones can do huge ones all right axi has like a four billion dollar market cap i think they can be easy 10 x's when the market picks back up and then we get the real gaming crypto bull run that i strongly believe is going to happen this year so as we go down the list of course good old d-race i think they're going to do very very well the premise of that game is just great situs is very low right now actually it's very very high but i think compared to where the market is like this would be very like star atlas launch with like an automatic billion dollar market cap sis in the same league if not better in my opinion i think i think a 500 million dollar market cap is on the table no problem for that game i also just invest in this minecraft mod almost that i think is going to do really well but i'm not going to talk about this channel the one i want to talk about is also really low in my opinion it's just monkeybone the cool thing we're seeing with like a lot of these that just ideoed is they did they did very poorly compared to the amount of hype around their ido and i think monkey ball will easily get to an overvaluation of like 200 million dollars at least so i think i think monkey ball at this point could possibly be a 10x has a lot of hype has really great marketing and i mean it does have a really good gameplay loop and basis around it as well another one spin which i recently just took props in but i have long term investments in it spin is a huge huge network of tons of pay-to-earn games i think it can be almost like a pay-to-earn kind of casino i think it's do really really well i think you can pull a gala games or vulcan forge kind of valuation again very very low at the market cap right here and again guys i'm not i'm so stressing in this video do not buy these right now if you go and buy these after i talk about the videos if there's some inevitable pump i'm trying to talk about a lot of coins so there isn't a pump you go buy these and you lose money i won i don't really care you're gonna lose money and you're doing you're just being an idiot okay do not buy these right now wait for the bitcoin reset and look at my micro cap buying video if you've not watched my micro cat buying video you have no you have no no business being within 50 feet of these things if you're new to kryptos your first couple months you have no business being within 50 feet of these things stick to the more conservative things i talked about and learn how to lose money and make money and then we can get into this because you can do what everybody else did at the last cycle and lose all their money again and then there's just so many other good projects like definia i mean just way down eight million dollar market cap and so look guys i i post a lot of lists on on my twitter all the time i suggest you go and look through a lot of those look at the projects you like find the future really really enjoy and then apply the thinking and logic i have for my microcap video and learn how to make your own list and if you're in the really gaming crypto learn how i look at gaming cryptos the thing is like when i made a lot of money in this last run everything was sitting at like a 5 million dollar market cap five to eight and so when i'm seeing things that are really good like made a gods for example a really good game sitting at these ten five million dollar market caps i see meta wars at nine mil you know i i see all these really low market caps on these projects and it just reminds me of like when i found d-race when it was at a five million dollar market cap you know and this thing went to eight bucks we got it like 85 cents 70 cents on this channel i mean altura was at a 3 million market cap when i got into it it slung shot to a 200 million dollar one when i sold it again it's in a back good buy range right here but when i see these games with these five eight million dollar market caps that i mean if we go a little bit lower gonna be right back in those five million dollar range and that's that's where i made tons and tons of money with that's where all my good trades were because we bought everything like altura way back here before everybody started foaming into it like we were buying all this stuff like right here you know so this is what we want to be doing and this is about the market caps where where i made those moves at and and and then we all got in we waited and then bam everybody else started getting into it way later on down the line so that's my two cents guys that's where i think the market is right now i want to get you a really really strong recap video of what i'm looking at what i think the market is doing this video has been way too long i think we got a lot of good ham jokes in so i don't think we need to end the video on a joke the ham jokes are on point today so follow me on twitter at cssbecker and uh i don't have anything else to say [Music] you",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe current cryptocurrency market is experiencing a mix of uncertainty and potential opportunities. The market sentiment is generally bearish, with many investors cautious due to economic factors like interest rate hikes and recession fears. However, there is optimism about the growth of certain sectors, such as gaming crypto and NFTs, which are seen as having solid use cases beyond speculative trading.\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin and Top Coins:** The speaker is cautious about predicting Bitcoin's movements but suggests that once Bitcoin starts to rise, smaller coins and micro-caps could see significant gains. They emphasize waiting for a confirmed Bitcoin uptrend before investing in other coins.\n\n- **Altcoins and Gaming Crypto:**\n  - **Solana, Avax, and Polygon:** These are highlighted as safer bets with potential for growth. Solana is noted for its speed, while Avax and Polygon are seen as having strong narratives and technical capabilities.\n  - **Gaming Crypto:** Projects like Sandbox, Gala, and Vulcan Forge are mentioned as promising due to their active user bases and potential for growth in the gaming sector.\n\n- **NFTs:** NFTs are viewed as having a solid foundation in luxury and vanity, with potential future applications in digital ownership of assets like real estate.\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Predictions:**\n  - **Avax:** Predicted to potentially reach $300 if the market cycle continues favorably.\n  - **Phantom:** Could reach a market cap similar to Avax's current level.\n  - **Remark and Moon River:** Seen as mid-level risk coins with potential for significant returns.\n\n- **Risks:**\n  - The speaker emphasizes the volatility of the crypto market and warns against buying coins without a solid understanding of the market.\n  - They caution that investing in micro-caps and gaming cryptos can be risky and should be approached with caution.\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Wait for Bitcoin's Movement:** Before investing in smaller coins, wait for a confirmed Bitcoin uptrend.\n- **Create a Personal List:** Instead of following others' recommendations, create a list of coins based on personal research and market analysis.\n- **Focus on Gaming and NFTs:** Consider investing in gaming crypto and NFTs due to their growing use cases and potential for long-term growth.\n- **Educate Yourself:** Learn about trading strategies and market dynamics before investing in risky assets like micro-caps.\n\n## Cryptocurrencies Mentioned\n\n- **Bitcoin**\n- **Solana**\n- **Avax (Avalanche)**\n- **Polygon**\n- **Phantom**\n- **Remark**\n- **Moon River**\n- **Cosmos**\n- **Luna**\n- **Vulcan Forge**\n- **Cdfi**\n- **Mines of Dalarnia**\n- **Thean Arena**\n- **D-Race**\n- **Situs**\n- **Star Atlas**\n- **Monkeyball**\n- **Spin**",

    "transcript": "I used to bide now I just stumble I had the answers now I just Mumble myose what's my Reas no matter what your opinion is new all-time Highs are definitely something that we'd all be looking for and that's certainly not what we've gotten over the last few weeks as Bitcoin has mostly been a stable coin I don't mind cuz I was on one of my only vacations of the year and I didn't miss much coming back I've come to notice a pretty dangerous Trend so I have a very strong message right now for the crypto Community her Bitcoin magazine we've just heard that Joe Biden is flipping and flopping and flipping once again on crypto and he's now supposedly going to be accepting crypto donations from the crypto Community now of course this is most likely in response to the fact that Trump has raised over a $100 million from the crypto Community I think it's probably far north of that because he has chosen to back the industry and he's making all kinds of bold claims supporting crypto which we'll get to a little later on in this episode but one of the great ironies is that he's doing so via coinbase Commerce now it's absolutely crazy because as bully here explains the Biden Administration is currently suing coinbase Kracken and Unis swap as unregistered Securities Brokers so how are you going to sell that crypto you raise are you going to sell it via coinbase VIA Kraken how are you going to sell the crypto on Unis swap it is absolutely disgusting the level of irony that Joe Biden decides he wants our crypto now just so we can have more money to wage a war on crypto am I reading that right what does he really think anyone's going to fall for this I'm certainly willing to donate to a good Democrat if they're going to say unseat Liz Warren or do something positive for the industry but you can't have years of destructive behaviors towards crypto and expect that we're just going to flip-flop and give you all of our precious coins and even more specifically docar wallet directly to you come on that's crazy and I Echo this sentiment okay the gall of these people they spent the last four years systematically trying to destroy crypto the industry that I love that literally my entire livelihood is here operation chokepoint 2.0 killing silvergate calling us tax cheats and terrorists suing every reputable crypto company and vetoing bipartisan legislation let us not forget that he vetoed a pro crypto Bill what was it just like 2 weeks ago or something I don't know as you can see from this clip uh he shakes Chuck Schumer's hand and then forgets about 3 seconds later uh but we didn't forget sir we didn't forget that you're trying to kill crypto and I don't think it's fair to be asking for our precious coins let me know how you think in the comment section below again it is an election year so I can't promise no politics but I can promise that I'm not giving my coins to someone who's trying to kill the industry in my view we are in the final half of what I call time-based capitulation you see I didn't think this was where we were going given the excitement that led up to the having the actual charting led us to believe that the cycle was about to take off much sooner than we've seen but what we've gotten instead is a tremendous amount of sideways the kind of sideways that gets people to capitulate yes sideways capitulation and that's because while bitcoin's going sideways a lot of the alts have slowly shed some significant market cap my message to you is quite simple do not let it win you see the first half of the bare Market is price-based capitulation that's when prices dump from extremely high values to extremely low values but then the second half of the Market is mostly time-based capitulation where people run out of dopamine you see few people realize how addictive the charts moving the news cycle the videos the updates all of the drama of crypto can be extremely intoxicating and without all of those consistent doses of energy people give up their coins now I found that the most boring and the most toxic that the crypto Community becomes is typically where the biggest opportunities arise now I grabbed this chart from My Buddy Miles and as you can see here the altcoin markets peaked exactly 546 days after the having the last two cycles that would mean that we're a very long way away from the altcoins actually peaking and you can see that they're not in the same aggressive near alltime High posturing that bitcoin's at no the data is showing that the Bitcoin run has been far ahead of the altcoins and while some channels might say Hey look it's time to capitulate those altcoins and jump into Bitcoin my personal belief is that it's not really necessary because if you're in the right altcoins which we'll discuss what the right ones are when the market does turn onwards and upwards words the gains are worth the wait not only by a little bit but by a lot of bit and so in my opinion the question is when is this going to happen but back to the key Point here is there could be some time here before we see a massive massive run in fact my current base case is that things will get real spicy in Q4 of this year but the truth is that the backdrop for crypto has simply never been better and that's because not only is the United States actively in the process of legalizing crypto and protecting against cbdcs giving a hospitable home for build of this industry like we've never seen before we're also on the verge of seeing the First Rate Cuts come to this monetary cycle the first in nearly three years literally as I'm recording this the fomc just came out with a hawkish Dot Plot meaning that they're not going to cut as many times as we thought but this is really close but many are predicting that this Dot Plot was decided before the CPI print yesterday which was super super soft In the End the Fed has to start cutting and whenever they do that they're going to be injecting liquidity into risk assets so whether that happens this year or next year it's going to be a massive Catalyst for the altcoins and for the more risky assets and it couldn't come at more perfect time and that's because Wall Street is not just waking up to bitcoin they're waking up to this entire industry $ 1.6 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton is going to begin a crypto fund and you can think of these as big dominoes that knock over many other dominoes essentially legitimizing this asset class all together this is why I think right now is a tremendous pivot point for the market and it is one of the biggest opport unities we'll see because right now utility coins have been as undervalued and hated as I've ever seen them even in the 2019 bare Market they're even more hated now because meme coins have actually pumped really hard now never mind the fact that there's about a million New Meme coins created today and almost all of them 99.999% of them go to literal zero the fact that a few of them pump really hard is attracting all of the Mind share of the degenerate money in crypto now for that reason I believe we will all get to enjoy some of the cheapest utility coin prices that we will ever see relative to where they're about to go in this cycle now of course if you bought early in the last two cycles it was quite similar because people were wildly underpricing the chance of crypto success and it's happening again but it's happening for the most important Builder coins in this entire Market whereas right now everyone's focusing on memes believing that there is no value in building stuff in crypto well I'm telling you this $1.6 trillion bucket of money is not going to be going after racist memes on the blockchain yes there has been way too much racist mem coin stuff going on I personally find it deplorable even though I do play around with some meme coins I do not think that this is where the big money is going to flock I believe in positioning around the most important use case narratives in this industry and getting there before the bankers do and that's precisely the topic that I'll be focusing on throughout the summer so while the current money in this industry turns its back on some of the most important infrastructure in the industry I'm going to be there to be scooping up coins and I'm going to tell you my thought process on what coins I find most valuable and where I think the big money is going to flow but in the meantime we have an incredible turn of events which is of course we have been covering how Donald Trump shifted single-handedly the political discourse around cryptocurrency in what seems like a fraction of a minute by just uttering that if you like crypto vote for Trump well things have gotten even more spicy as he has gotten deeper into the crypto Community now saying that he wants all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA which I find to be a hilarious thing to say but essentially he's saying that Bitcoin will help America be energy dominant this reflects a fairly sophisticated understanding of Bitcoin mining and that essentially he wants America to be the home of Bitcoin mining which is a stance we have not heard reflected anywhere else in the political Spectrum specifically in the United States this is a major major step forward and it shows that at least one side of the political aisle is really understanding crypto and the hope is that this will actually translate to the other side of the aisle as well remember my allegiance here on this channel is to free money the Joe Biden meme at the beginning of this video is just funny I think anyone can appreciate it but let's be real I just want a free and hospitable home for cryptocurrency in the United States and I don't intend to make this Channel about politics at all however there has become an existential reality that one side of politics has recently been very obsessed with trying to kill crypto so let's just keep our reality hats on here and just understand that this election crypto is on the ballot now if that weren't enough it's important to realize that there's been another major shift a major shift that many people might not understand just how big it is and that is that China has once again re-entered the chat we have here an exclusive view here this is the third largest offshore exchange bibit now biit had been cutting off Chinese Nationals for many many years believe it or not when China says not to do something you don't mess with them in fact I believe a lot of the biit employees are from mainland China it's not confirmed but I believe that's the case that's what I've heard and bit has cut off Chinese users a very long time ago but now you can use a Chinese Mainland ID card to actually get a buyit account and this is a wildly big change of events now for people who weren't here in the olden days crypto was pretty much a Chinese phenomenon it was started here in the west but it became wildly popular in China and the roots of this go back to trading World of Warcraft gold in the early 201s if you were around in the 2016 and 2017 days you'll know that bit main Bitcoin miners were effectively the best equipment you could buy these were these application specific integrated circuits or ASI miners that you had to buy if you wanted to mine Bitcoin and they were made by a company called bitm which was out of China that was a quick little history lesson for you here the net effect was that almost all of the Bitcoin mining was happening in China and the Chinese retail crypto audience was monstrously big this was equal to if not bigger than the American crypto audience and part of the logic was that people were trying to get money out of China and this was a very effective way to do so this change of pace by biit is effectively an indication that China is loosening up their stance on crypto and if they're loosening up their stance not just on having some ETFs something to that effect but actually letting their users trade crypto once again well this could be absolutely massive now we know China is all about the stop start the we'll open the curtain close the curtain open it again they never try to let their people get too comfortable and they're certainly not lovers of individual freedoms but let's just say this unequivocally if China can start trading more freely in cryptand we have no idea really the heights that Bitcoin and other cryptos could fly this cycle it could be an astronomical win now despite that Bitcoin has been mostly a stable coin around 69k we've seen non-stop accumulation by the ETFs which now hold uh over 300,000 Bitcoin or 21 billion doll in Bitcoin you can see that it's the fastest ETF ever to reach $20 billion in assets ibit and that's just what what was this 150 days the next one in line was almost 3 years right almost a thousand days here and you had ibit here in less than half a year this is crazy a third year this is absolutely monstrous performance now something worth noting is that a lot of the Bitcoin buying right now in the ETF is actually what they call Cash and Carry trades now without getting into the details essentially people are buying the ETF where there's a price discrepancy between the ETF and the actual spot markets of Bitcoin they're buying the ETF and maybe selling uh shorts on the open market so what people think is happening here is that most of this ETF buying is by big institutions that are arbitraging between little price differences between the public Bitcoin markets and maybe the stock market you can think of it as that they they're arbitraging little changes in the spot Market differences mostly essentially the data thinks people are buying Bitcoin and then selling Futures so it's a market neutral trade that they're getting a little bit of Arbitrage on now I don't think I can explain this in a very simple way but you could think of this as they're buying Bitcoin for 69k and then they're selling it on the open market for 69k and $10 or something like that and they're doing it in big size so they're buying a lot but selling an equal amount on the open market and that's why the price hasn't gone Skyward and that explains how you can have tens of billions of dollars in accumulation of ETFs and not that much price change on the Bitcoin open markets this is a very interesting Dynamic but it once again brings us back to this chart and shows us that yeah we've had a huge uptick in bitcoin price here but we are still in these boring zones here we're still in these early zones I mean look at the uh two cycles ago it looks like a flat line there's absolutely no topography here and in the last cycle from the having where we're at it was you know several months before we started seeing really major price increases however by the end of the year you know 6 months out we did see the hockey stick begin and that's the hope is that by about 6 months out we'll start seeing the real hockey stick take shape meanwhile an update is that I am adding Robin Hood to my sort of more traditional safe portfolio for crypto exposure because they just bought a crypto exchange bit stamp I'm not going to go too deep into this but this is a similar thought process to coinbase although I don't think they have nearly the drivers that coinbase have I think Robin Hood is a decent buy so I've added it to my portfolio again this is more of a St play I don't think it's going to get you a 10x here this is probably a few X's but essentially I'm just converting some of the t- bills that I have been sitting on into Robin Hood stock now we're about to get into the altcoin sector of this and I'm going to start giving you my thesis on what's going to play out because it's clear that crypto is in as good of a position as it's ever been however it's important now to talk about how I'm going to be positioning for the next sector of crypto before I do that though I want to shout out my sponsor of course as you guys know my only sponsor on this channel is nordvpn this is by far the simplest and easiest way to protect yourself online as a crypto user if you're not using nordvpn you're being an absolute fool because you can protect yourself with such ease and it's literally a couple of bucks a month you can get a big fat juicy discount for signing up in the description below with the link there it supports the channel and I appreciate you again it's just a couple of dollars a month fully refundable if you don't like it as I've said before there are many mistakes you can make while browsing and trading crypto but not using a VPN is so silly you won't be forgiven for that one so definitely get a VPN it is worth your couple bucks a month now let's get to the juicy stuff throughout the last few months I've seen a lot of tweets like this this is a May tweet here from OSF he's saying he sold all of his soul for whiff and the thesis is the dog has a hat look May 27th I'm not here to roast him so on May 25th dog with hat had a price of what was this uh 318 3 you know but in in in a little over 310 right it was pretty volatile right now it's sitting at 275 uh whereas salana had a price of 168 168 here uh 169 and now it's sitting at 158 so they both dropped um I'm not sure I didn't calculate the percentage drop what I'm trying to say here is that this mentality has become very popular which is that why am I betting on these assets with a ton of utility when I should just bet on the memes cuz the memes are going to pump harder the memes more pumpy more upy up up and that's all that matters in crypto well I'm here to tell you that that is a bare Market strategy that is only being popularized in my opinion by a bunch of degenerates that have been burned too many times we've all become jaded and in my opinion that is not what the future at least the institutional next chapter of crypto is going to yield I believe the next institutional buyer chapter of crypto is going to be all about infrastructure and utility now of course retail Mania whenever that comes will definitely be important and it will probably see a lot of mem coins but remember a lot of the retail Traders are living month to month paycheck to paycheck and the big money is being held by institutions who are chasing free yield from the Federal Reserve in treasury bills that are getting paid more than theyve ever gotten paid in the past 20 30 years to just hold T bills so of course that's what they're doing right now and as soon as we start getting rate cuts which we talked about that money is going to start flowing into risk assets but not forchan memes it's going to be flowing into what it sees as the leading King made most important protocols in crypto and I believe that this mentality and by the way OSF is a big friend of the channel highly respect him I'm just using this to illustrate a point this mentality is going to open up the biggest opportunities in the space for the protocols that are still building and so it's really important to understand which ones are still building and will be underpriced and under valued when that does happen now for me I've been saying soul is one of my easy plays of the cycle I've been saying it since it was way sub $20 obviously I didn't get the $8 Buy in but I was buying between 13 and 17 very heavily and Chris berisi says Soul at $1,000 is a similar fully diluted value to eth at 5K one cycle behind I believe that this is a fair comparison because people compare soul and eth quite a bit there's a bit of a war there and I believe soul is in many ways more advanced than eth was on the last cycle in some ways in some ways it's not but at the same time it's a very compelling narrative and I believe that it equating to something around where eth had at 5K last cycle that could very easily be a compelling argument certainly something that I wouldn't be shy of but my target was all this time $800 I made the price Target call out in the middle of the bar market and all stick with it I'll certainly be a seller with soul at $800 maybe not all of my stack but a really really big chunk and now it's time for me to talk briefly before I get into other altcoins about what's going on because the thing I'm most passionate right now about it's not trading trading has become quite boring I have most of my positions they haven't changed and that's why I haven't been doing a lot of content because I don't have updated trading advice for you I'm just holding on to these positions I'm not going to capitulate them and I'm going to wait for the market to wake up and to flow money into the most valuable coins in AI gaming layer ones and utility coins that I think are going to change the world and speaking of the coins that I think are going to change the world I want to be very clear the team at superverse is working morning tonight building one of the most important pieces of infrastructure that this industry has seen I believe what's happening at superverse and what will be coming to superverse with the layer 2 solution will be one of the most important steps forward and I also believe that there is a blessing finally in the gaming Market in that people are talking about crypto gaming being dead once again now they were talking about crypto gaming being dead all throughout the 2023 bare market and that's when I got to scoop up the best protocols in the space for absolutely Dirt Cheap a disgusting disrespectful discount and I believe that there will be a chance for people to scoop up discounted coins during the next month or two a per perod which we have to be joking now is called sideways summer because it has been so sideways but for me it is super summer because the amount of building and development going on there is absolutely crazy and in a world where institutions are starting to pick up crypto assets I believe that they will go for category leaders in the most important categories in the space and as such the mission of superverse has to be to lead the category to be one of the most attractive assets for those institutions to be exposed to that should be the end goal is to get institutional support for institutional grade infrastructure with all that said I am surrounded shrouded in negativity about utility coins about gaming coins all I hear is people abandoning their bags to go buy meme coins and I can tell you right now unequivocally that I've never been more bullish that I am speeding up and putting effort into the most important things while other people are turning away and slowing down I've done this so many times I've seen this movie so many times where people have told me that what I'm working on and focused on isn't that meaningful or isn't going to be valuable and my thesis has remained unchanged and this is why I've been able to perform so highly is that when you build a thesis that has a clear and directed end point and is backed by Logic data and then a little bit of foresight it's really easy to shake off the doubters I'm not only confident that superverse will be a category leader in gaming but I believe that what superverse is working on will become one of the most important things happening in the industry so that's what I'm going to be focusing on all summer it is going to be a Super Summer and there's going to be a ton of fun stuff going on but just know that while people turn their back on utility on infrastructure I believe that they are turning their back on the biggest pieces of the biggest pie in the entire world now of course memes will do well but they will mostly be short-lived and getting your thousand X winners is going to be very hard when everybody's chasing them and there's a million new coins per day whereas finding time tested category winners that don't have a ton of VC unlocks coming those are opportunities that anyone can Sleepwalk into sit on and end up doing incredibly well from I'm going to be making a big updated portfolio list that you can see the things that I'm focused on I've also started collaborating with and Advising several projects in the space that I think have potential to really deliver interesting products that I think could actually become significant protocols in the space some of which I already had positions in some of which I didn't I'll be going over those on upcoming videos point of today's video isn't an extensive portfolio list but it's really a message that this is not the end of utility coins and in fact I believe that utility altcoins especially those in the most important niches AI gaming L1 L2 maybe even some defi stuff those will start to become incredibly imp important assets as institutions start to warm up to crypto and as this bull run really starts to take off now to be clear we did get rejected at the range highs last week my Quant told me that that was a pretty significant rejection and that means that we'll probably spend some time sorting ourselves out reaccumulate price in the mid to low $60,000 territory which again is a chance that probably altcoins and several other narratives will be on massive massive discounts I know what I'll be doing I'll be allocating whatever new capital I have to crypto though I am pretty much fully allocated for my stable coins I do have my cash reserves on the side that are non- crypto but I'm probably just going to let those sit there because knowing there's some cash there helps me just be full risk on in crypto and not worry about it because in the end my strategy was to put away a little cash and I'm never going to put into crypto and I'll just live off that and that way I can stand by my convictions really really strongly knowing that I'm willing to risk all this Capital to not only join the elites of society which is a silly thing to actually need to do but to actually accomplish my goals because capital is the actual life force of building the stuff I want to build and to that effect I'm going to be doing a lot of really cool stuff here that I'm very excited about trying to expand the content here to be wildly different than stuff you've seen in the past I'm very excited to show you guys all of that so make sure you're staying tuned but my message I want to be very clear here which is that crypto is going to heat up again it's going to heat up massively and utility altcoins will have their day in the sun once again so my belief is that you should not capitulate your coins here because if you do you will end up in a world of hurt when all of a sudden the big institutional money turns their eyes on eth on salana on the core infrastructure that powers this industry and if you're sidelined in the H 100th iteration of a poorly drawn meme I think you're going to be in a lot of pain as real money chases real technology as always if you guys enjoyed this you know what to do smash that like button share the video and I'll be back very soon with more content thank you [Music]",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing a period of stability, with Bitcoin maintaining relatively steady prices. However, there is a growing anticipation for significant price movements, particularly as institutional investors begin to show more interest in the sector. The regulatory environment remains a crucial factor, with ongoing debates about how cryptocurrencies should be classified and regulated.\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin and Altcoins:** Bitcoin has been stable, while altcoins have seen significant market cap reductions. The speaker suggests that altcoins, particularly those with strong utility narratives, will see substantial gains when institutional money flows into the market.\n\n- **Institutional Interest:** Major financial institutions like Franklin Templeton are entering the crypto space, which could legitimize cryptocurrencies further and drive growth.\n\n- **Regulatory Developments:** The U.S. government's stance on crypto is evolving, with President Trump's administration taking a more crypto-friendly approach. This includes plans for a strategic cryptocurrency reserve and a shift in regulatory oversight.\n\n- **China's Role:** China is re-entering the crypto scene, which could lead to increased demand and price surges for cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Predictions:** The speaker believes that utility altcoins will see significant gains, with Solana potentially reaching $800. However, this is speculative and based on the assumption that institutional investors will focus on utility over meme coins.\n\n- **Risks:** There are concerns about market manipulation, regulatory uncertainty, and the potential for government influence over cryptocurrency markets. The inclusion of altcoins in a national reserve could also introduce volatility risks.\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Diversification:** Investors are advised to focus on utility altcoins and infrastructure projects, as these are expected to attract institutional investment.\n\n- **Patience:** The speaker suggests holding onto positions and waiting for the market to turn, as the current sideways trend is part of a larger cycle.\n\n- **Risk Management:** Investors should be cautious of regulatory changes and market volatility, ensuring they have a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks.\n\n## Cryptocurrency Coins Mentioned\n\n- **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n- **Ethereum (ETH)**\n- **Solana (SOL)**\n- **Cardano (ADA)**\n- **XRP**\n\n## Stocks and Other Investments\n\n- **Robin Hood:** The speaker has added Robin Hood to their portfolio due to its acquisition of a crypto exchange, though it's noted as a more stable play rather than a high-growth opportunity.",

    "transcript": "But you can't tell the vibe's in crypto right now. They're getting immaculate. And it's the late to the party lemming copycat b t you are, of course, you've turned to the alpha, the omega, the golden God of crypto the most woke himself because you're finally realizing, oh, that jacked good looking mother who's been screaming there's gonna be a bull run. Screaming, we're gonna get 2030 x's. Heck, been calling them all year, perfectly positioning my cult of future world leaders, the future wealth creators, the future yacht buyers. The future are only fans, greatest donators for the run that's about to happen. And you're thinking right now, how do I get in on this? It's looking like I'm gonna be too late. But lucky for you, you little incel virgin, you still have time. See, lucky for you, the alpha kol. I have no friends. I have no social life. I sit here, I grind. I'm fueled by incel rage. I've evolved. I am the prime form of crypto, incel evolution. And so, again, lucky for you, the most woke. I'm not in Singapore at 2049, getting drunk at Sausage fest, taking pictures with d less kols, acting like I have friends. Ha. This is crypto. I got all my socializing and f out in high school. I don't have time for that. You don't have time for that because right now, it's time to lock in. We are on the cusp of the biggest bull run in history. And if you're watching this video right now, you're sitting down right at the prime time, because the signs are apparent. Crypto looks like it's about to take off. And the coins that are going to deliver 1020 30 x returns, they're still down, but like a 21 year old who just popped Viagra in ecstasy, they will not stay down for long. So in this video, I'm gonna give you your last shot, your last swing at glory, by giving you an overview of what this bull run is about to look like. I'm gonna show you where the coins are gonna be pumping at. I'm gonna show you the sectors that are gonna be hot. And like always in this video, I'll be talking about a few coins I'll be getting into. The big, chunky ones I think are gonna deliver the gains and then the higher risk ones are gonna deliver the. But I'm gonna be subtle with it and kind of strivel them throughout the video. I'm not gonna just sit and list all of them because I know a lot of people just come to this channel. They skip to the end of the video and they're like, yeah, explains. And then they leave. And then they don't understand what they're doing and then they lose all their money. So I'm gonna snivel these throughout the video. So you just gotta pay attention. You gotta, you gotta actually come and watch the content. You gotta, you gotta put up with this piece of for another 20 minutes. And I'm gonna give you a roadmap you can use right now and absolutely maximize this bull run. Because once the this starts, you frankly, realistically, jokes aside, even intro aside, you're not going to have time. If you looked at how every bull run in history has worked, people are all flicking their tits, thinking, I'll buy lower, I'll get in when it looks bullish, and then it's too late. And by talking about it, I mean lay it out in this video. And by laying it out in this video, I mean, I'm going to lay out these things. We're going to talk about where the market's at right now, talk about how this bull run is likely to look, and then we're going to talk about the sectors and coins that are thriving, pulpating, pulsating, ready to pump right now. And if you so choose, if your testosterone will allow, if your wife, girlfriend, who dominates your life, finally lets you have a moment of peace, you may rise to the level of the alpha Omega. Kol, actually, you'll never get to this level, but you could be a really, really efficient groupie. You could be my groupie and raise to the level of incel friendless, crypto degenerate, born again virgin, which is what I want to help you do here. Because sitting in your house in a hoodie all by yourself at 03:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning, waving a gun around, this is where you want to be. This is what you want your kids to look back on and be like, dad was a fucking loser, but at least he made money in crypto. But for real, let's talk about the bull. It's going to be huge. Let me, let me bring up my computer. And away we go. So if we're going to look at this crypto bull run and take it seriously, you need to understand what's happening in the markets right now. And I'm going to tell you what's happened in the markets. And you should really listen, because I'm always right about everything I said. Biggest bitcoin would never go below sixty k. And it looks like I finally called it right here. You're looking at the guy who called the last time bitcoin will ever go under 60k. You better yet, better hope you're here before I call 70k. But on a serious note, I did call the recent lows on Twitter. I've been pointing out these really juicy opportunities all year. You should be following me at Zssbecker on Twitter. That's where you get the earliest updates, the coins. I'm looking at my thoughts on the market much sooner and the posting is oh, oh, oh. But for real, follow me there. It takes me forever to make these videos and so everyone's getting really excited about crypto. I really would encourage you on a serious note, character side, watch my last video because that's a really realistic look at what the bull run is likely to do. That's my God's honest prediction. And I will link to that at the end of this video. But I want to give you a quick little overview recap of what's about to happen. Because on a serious front right here, first off, this is not financial advice. Why are you watching this channel for financial advice? What about this channel makes you think, hey, this is where I should get my investing tips? Stop it. Leave. Never invest in crypto. We're going to lose all of our money. 95% of people that get into crypto, they lose all their money. Look, if you're even semi new to this, I guarantee later this year it's going to get super high and I'm going to dump with everybody else. I'm going to savagely turbo dump all my coins because my goal here is to leave in profit. And you're just going to get turbo mad at me because you don't know what you're doing and then yell at your dog and then claim crypto is a scam for the rest of your life. You just cut to the chase and not do that. You should just leave this channel. That's your warning. When you get mad, I will post this clip saying, I told you so. But for the few of you that still want to sit here and gamble with your life savings, oh, we got the content for you, you piece of. So, on that note, we're looking at a cataclysmic bull run right here. Do I know if this is going to happen in the next few weeks or months? No, but it's very likely. And the risk right here is being unexposed. What does that mean? All right. If we get a bull run right here from this point right here, and urinalts 2030 X's are going to rain from the sky. If it's anything like past crypto bull runs, they're going to rain from the sky. And we're looking at the most liquidity coming in the crypto ever. So things that could get out of control. So the upside right here is 2030 X's. It's. It's outrageous. The downside here is that we have to wait longer. There are three things that can happen right now. One, we can have a nuclear bull run like I just talked about. Two, absolutely nothing happens for another six months. Three, we get a big recession. Everything. Nukes. In my opinion, one and two are pretty damn likely number three, eh, I don't think we're at the recession point right now. There's so much money sidelined. There's so many people waiting to get into all markets. There is money being printed right now in terms of assets. I don't see a recession happening. So what do I mean when I say the risk is to the downside? If you are sidelined right now, if you are not in crypto, missing out on gains like this, not just in crypto, but all assets will leave you in a much lower income class, societal class, than everybody who's investing in assets right now, which is not actually a lot of people, there's more money sidelined and people being like, I'll wait for the recession and buy lower. That's what Warren Buffett's doing. Mother, Warren Buffett is not buying crypto ever. Warren Buffett is 95 years old, I think. I don't know. Editor, please fact check me here. Warren Buffett is 163 years old. He's not taking risk. If you're like me and you have another couple years on this planet, at least two, you got to take risk. And so the risk here is missing out on this. Not particularly. The two negative outcomes I listed, where one, if nothing happens the next six months, oh, well, okay, we're just going to sit around and shit, post on Twitter a little bit longer. If a recession happens, shit, bitcoin is going down to 30,000 something dollars like that. Our alts will get wiped out. But losing 50%, 60% of our money here, again, you shouldn't be investing with your entire life savings. I don't do that. You don't do that. Losing that small chunk of money that we're gambling here is not going to kill us. That's my view on it. And so we're looking at a market right now. Let's talk about the actual market and what I think is about to happen. And then we'll get into those juicy coins, go crack yourself a beer, light up a cigarette, because this is going to be unbearable. Just going to have to suffer through. So now let's talk about the market. And like I said, I'm going to striple in some coins and things I'm looking at, and chunks of the industry I think are going to pop. But let's look at the market. Okay. As you know on this channel, I always look at bitcoin as my judge of how the entire market's going to go. If bitcoin's dumping, everything's going to be dumping. If bitcoin is going up to 80,000, $90,000, we're going to see cataclysmic alt runs. So we're looking at bitcoin right now at 63k. With institutions buying in, we're looking at bitcoin right now with countries buying in, we're looking at bitcoin right now with Trump wanting to throw the United States dollar behind it. We're looking at crypto right now with all these huge things happening and it's still being in a fear level. You can see the fear greed den is at neutral. Imagine when this thing gets the big bulging erection green. It's going to be ridiculous. And in my opinion, I think the price is being smothered. I realize that is what every idiot says before the market takes a massive dump. So please screenshot that, quote me and use that to add to your every time. Alex Becker was wrong compilation. I'm sure those get a lot of views using the Alpha Sigma kol instant way to get clicks on YouTube. It's no problem, I don't mind. But that's what I think is going on. Because right now the price action is just ridiculous. But you're not seeing crypto in the news. You're not seeing crypto search volume reflecting what we've seen in past bull runs. You're seeing crypto searches, crypto views, crypto clicks at rock bottom lows. This means the mass public has no interest in crypto right now. You look at how Coinbase is issuing bitcoin and how they're selling bitcoin. They're not doing it on the markets in books, they're doing it privately or they're doing IOU's, which tells me that institutions are trying to buy as much as they possibly can. These institutions do not play fair. They don't. They come in and be like, okay, guys, we're just gonna pump the price while everybody's already bought in. No, they want to stuff as much of this as they can, then stuff it all over the news and pump the hell of it. Especially when the money printer turns back on, which it is. Especially when rates get lower again, which it is. And so the opportunity here, if I'm right about those things, is just stupid now. Right now, if you're in the markets, a lot of people have been giving me poop about altcoins being down 80%. Quick history lesson on how altcoins work. If you hold altcoins from lows and you want to hold them to the absolute tops, let's look at BNB right here. So I'm not going to zoom in right here, because I like to keep the content quality here nice and low and keep you kind of guessing at what I'm saying. Great for watch time. But if we look at BNB right here, during the 2017 run, all the way up to where it peaked out at, this coin went and actually did from one dollar to thirty two dollars. So did a 32 x at this point. Everyone was exhausted. They're like this. There's no way this coin can go higher. Then the thing took an 80% dive down to $10. Almost somewhere around here. It's like there. And then people thought, oh, it's dumb. It's. You should have sold up here. How stupid of you to hold this back. And then it went and did a little, almost 30, 20 x from its last all time high. If you're looking at altcoins, if you're playing an altcoins, the coins we like to dive into on this channel because we actually like to make money. You don't make money in bitcoin. Okay? As much as people want to tell you, you make money in the silly, silly, dirty red light district. Altcoins. And what you need to understand is we bought the lows in November, which is very similar to this right here. Okay? And then we held up, and now we're down like 60, 70% on some coins. Now, not every coin that we got into is going to come back. This is the essence of high risk trading. But a lot of them are. And if you want to hold to these levels right here, if your. If your goal is to do this, is to buy coins at lows and wait for a turbo bull run. On the way to the turbo bull run, you're going to see 60, 70%, 80% dips we saw it literally in the biggest coin. You're going to see it in a little high risk coins we like to play in. So what's probably going to happen here as we get up to the election? Bitcoin's going to charge because it looks like Trump is going to win, and everybody thinks Trump is good for bitcoin. Now, I'm not going to get in the politics here, but if you're voting for Kamala Harris, you're voting for your own personal seppuku. When it comes to crypto investing. If you invest in trade in coins like this and you're voting for 45% capital gains and 25% unrealized tax, that is like being a guy that goes to orgies and investing in an anti condom campaign. No, no, no. You don't get to have that as a hobby and keep those beliefs. You need those condoms, trust me. Same thing. That's as deep as I'm going to get into the politics right here. By all means, let's not talk about staying in permanent wars and flipping elections with illegal immigration and censoring free speech. Those things aren't important. Those aren't those. Who cares about those making memes illegal in California? This is. These are completely normal things that you should support behind your political party. It's completely fine. So regardless, people think Trump is going to win, and that's going to be good for bitcoin. But here's a flip side to this that people don't want to hear. If Kamala wins, it's also probably good for bitcoin because they're going to destroy the dollar, they're going to get back to printing, they're going to fund and launder all the things that they've been trying to do. And just like we saw of COVID asset prices are going to pump. So I think we're looking at a pump either way. Just one requires a destruction of our currency and other is based around the economy. Actually doing well. Either way is great for us, though. We made a lot of money in Covid. If Covid and inflation and the irresponsible money printing, had it happened, the whole entire last bull run wouldn't have been so crazy. On the flip side, if Kamala does win, your goal is to make as much money as fast as possible, get the heck out of the United States. So if Kamal wins, a, your goal is to make as much money as possible before we just nuke everything. But either way, we can make a lot of money here. And so I think as we lead up to election, we're going to see bitcoin start to pump. And as bitcoin gets to 80, $90,000, these coins down here are going to start getting going parabolic. I think particularly Solana Avax are going to do super duper well. So if I was building like a big portfolio just to start off with, and I wanted to be basic and just simple, I just get Solana and Avax, you know, you could even throw in some meme coins like Doge and get really meme y with Cardano. I mean, that's the top tier. I'm just kidding. Homebank Cartoon no. Unless you're one of those people who likes to go to orgies without comms. In that case, you're a big fan of AIds. So, I mean, in that case, you should definitely pick up Ada because it will definitely give it to you. That in crypto sense. But for everybody else that wants to keep a clean bill of health, that's really where I would just be looking at. I think chain link is finally going to also do very well as well, because what we're looking at, too, you have to understand, is that we're going into actual adoption of crypto. All the banking and finance and payment solutions are all looking at for this. Paying $300 for a transaction on theorem is for some reason, finally becoming unpopular. People are finally asking the question, how do we use this technology if it takes 15 minutes to transact and requires $200 per transaction? The golden question we've all been asking for years in crypto is finally becoming relevant. And so I think Solana can go just do very well from here. An dollar 800,000 Solana and Peak bull run I see very easily happen, especially if ethereum just keeps getting smashed and smashed and smashed, and the blatant brokenness of its technology keeps becoming a bigger topic. In my opinion, there's two places that are going to be really, really big, and that's going to be AI and gaming. I talk about those every video. But the thing I also think you need to keep in mind is that crypto utility is coming back. We had this huge nihilistic meme experience in crypto, but with salon and things actually being adopted by major companies, for example, you know, one of the biggest games dropping next year is going to be a blockchain game off the grid, which has its own coin. You should be checking that out when it drops. That's going to be on Avax. So we're seeing games gaming companies literally start gaming and putting their technology on mainstream chains, we're starting to see payment solutions, putting their stuff on Solana. And as these things happens, things that actually do stuff in crypto are starting, are going to start getting bids, overwhelmingly overhyped bids, as people panic and FOMo back into this as all assets pump. And so I think good boring picks, this is, this is one thing I suggest that no one's going to like, but good old boring picks could get you a nice 1015 x here. Stuff like uniswap, immutable x, which I think is going to lead if gaming pumps immutable x is going to do super duper well. Filecoin and just storage solutions, theta network and data solutions, Polygon, you have to. You have to look at Polymarket. It's probably one of the first mainstream adoption things going on right now. And so I think Polygon will just get a bid regardless of that. And ethereum is so broken, and people are going to be like, Polygon, Polygon, Polygon. And so I think that could make a huge comeback. And then, of course, as we get down here, looking at how Nvidia is performing last year, people are going, AI hype is out of control. I think gaming is going to do very well for a completely different reason. But the hype behind AI is just ridiculous. So if we just want to get in the big, chunky AI coins, Akash is where I'd be going. And if I want to get into big exposure and gaming, I just go, IMX. And so that portfolio I just listed, if you are not an absolute piece of garbage who's been in crypto last five years, that's what I would do. Because the coins I'm about to get into here in a second, and the industries I'm about to explain, you got to understand the markets flow and what's going on and how people in crypto behave. You're gonna get your butt handed to you. And if you dabble on anything a little bit more risky, if you get in these coins, you're probably still gonna get your butt handed to you, but not as bad. And even if you make a lot of mistakes after we pump here, you're probably still leaving some profit. Quant being another fantastic coin in that portfolio that I just listed. So where are we gonna pump the hardest? Those right there. Now, another narrative you want to look for is Solana and Avax, I think, are gonna pump very hard. And I think Tron could catch a bit. I don't know how, I don't know where, I don't know why. I think it's gonna be maybe a meme coin leader. I don't. I don't know. This is like, this is like watching your cousin in the trailer park who sleeps with his sister and has 15 incest children, becoming a billionaire by winning the lottery. I don't like it, but it's happening all right. It's. But what you want to look at, and a good strategy is going to work really well in this whole utility hype, is looking at the Dexs and the oracles on these, change the tools underneath them. So Solana, radium, the uniswaps, the chain links on Solana, same thing on Tron. Near is also fantastic, too. I think that's all going to do very, very well. I think it's all going to do super duper well. Now, if I'm looking to make cataclysmic amounts of money in crypto, there's two places I think are going to pump, and they're no secret to what they are, but I want to explain them just a little bit more detail for you if you're new here. So AI coins are the most obvious choice here. And this is like that inevitable thing I've been talking about for a while. And it's finally, it's, it's at the point where it's almost about to be too late, in my opinion, because once these things start moving, the market cap is so stupidly like the AI. The market cap of all of it right now is $33 billion. And then most of the coins on here right now are not even AI coins. So it's probably close to the $20 billion. And then if you look at the market cap, it just doge, this is like the market cap of one dogecoin. I don't even think it's the market cap of peak dogecoin. During the last bull run, this thing could go to a trillion dollar market cap. No problem with hype following it. Expecting all the AI crypto industry to be like one 10th of Nvidia, that's a little bit overplayed. I don't know what Nvidia's exact market cap right here, because I don't touch that thing. That thing scares me. But expecting it to go even one 10th of the way to Nvidia, things Nvidia's market cap, easy. And so if I'm looking to just no brainer, impatiently get rich in this borrower, I'm going to be going for AI coins. Now there's, there's a go look at my AI video that's linked below this video in the description for a big long list of AI coins off the top of my head. If I'm just a beginner getting started, I'm going to get into Nier, I'm going to get into Akash. Now, I don't own either of these because I like to. I like to live dangerously. But if I'm just a big dodo, that's what I'm getting into. The biggest coin I'm going to be getting into that's large, but still small enough to make really good gains. Aos echelon prime. The ties into gaming. Oh, super good coin as well. I'm picking eyes over it, but both these are really good. If you like the branding and the yellow color right here. And you think this name is cooler than this name, you should definitely go with Echelon prime. And that's really the primary way you want to invest in crypto. You have to go by the logos and names. That is how you pick the best ponzi to get into. That is why you don't want to get into Cardano because the branding, the logo, the name, very lame. It sounds like an unsuccessful italian restaurant if they just named it. But. But anal age would be a much better representation of what the coin actually provides and I think it would have done a lot better. But, you know, whatever. I'm not here to help with branding. Mick Cuck N Fluff being a very strong second to it. Could you see it like, hey man, I just invested in McCuck and fluff. I really identify with it since my wife dates other men. That would have worked so much better for Cardano holders and would have worked so much better for the branding, but they just didn't go with it because, I don't know, I guess they have some ego or something. Anyways, those are where I would be going if I want some big, chunky, easy coins. Now. I think the best performers, pal Destra easy choices if we're looking at some big chunky gains without getting too dirty. Another one I just added recently, palm AI. I think veracity is really underplayed right here. Zkml really underplayed. And if you want a deeper list of coins, this is all I'm going to get into in this video. And I'm not going to describe how each of these coins work because we've already had a long enough video right here. I'm just giving you some places to look at and start diving into on the AI market. Now, for looking at gaming, this is actually where I'm most excited and everybody is most not excited if they don't know what's going on. So let me type this in. Okay. All right, so look, gaming is the most slept on thing in all of crypto right now. And I have a huge gaming video coming up next week, so you should really investigate gaming before I spill the beans on it next week. Why? So AI is by far the most hype driven narrative. Why are people going to invest in AI? Because Nvidia is up, so these will go up as well. All right. And that's really only amount of investing logic you really need in crypto. This. This space is fucking harded. It's the dumbest, dumbest place in all of investing. You are in the absolute cesspit of finance. Welcome. Come rub the poo on your body, bask in the piss. But the thing is, gaming's actually about to grow up and become a mature investment in crypto. Oh. We've actually made one thing in the entire history of crypto that works. Let me explain. So gaming and blockchain technology is paired with games like peanut butter and jelly. I would compare it very closely to online gaming. For example, remember when games, online gaming was just starting to happen, and you could just log into random servers and there'd be people there with racial slurs as their names and. And there'd be people with, you know, names with like a dog named cock as their, as their player names. You remember just back in the day when the Internet, online gaming was just disgusting. No one really thought was gonna be that big. Back then, for example, when Doom started using the Internet for players to fight each other, and everybody thought was like a cool novelty, but no one was like, this is the future. Let's invest in online gaming companies. Imagine if you invested in online gaming companies then, or maybe the next ten years after that. So saying blockchain and gaming isn't gonna happen is like saying online access and gaming isn't gonna happen. It's just easy. Not gonna happen. It's a far better way to organize data ownership. And when people think about online gaming, they think of it like crypto, degens, and like nfts and all the stupid stuff we saw before. No, it's just really a better way to organize code for games. That's it. That's all it is. Now as AI becomes a bigger thing, and I'll talk about this more in the gaming video, the amount of games are going to be able to hit the market quickly and need some type of infrastructure for asset management is going to also skyrocket. So in the next year or so, we have so many great aaa high quality level games here in the market. Not this terrible stuff we saw last, boring stuff that people are actually going to play. And the way people interact with blockchain in these games is completely seamless. You log in, you have a wallet, you have a chain connection, you're already trading and owning crypto assets without any interaction. There's no wallet sign up, there's no one pitching you some Ponzi and telling you to store all your money on blockfi. It's just straight up like playing any other game. And once this happens, the demand for crypto gaming infrastructure is going to go parabolic. And when that happens, every game in the space is going to get untold amounts of speculation. So where do we want to look at in this space? Immutable X is going to be the leader here. Very simply, I'll explain more next video. I'm not going to get into the actual genesee, Pa, in this video because we've been talking too long. Beam, just be in Beam b and beam. And then super. If I'm making the three horsemen of the popular apocalypse, which would technically be four, but, you know, whatever. We got the editor here to fact check me. These are what I'm going to just build my basic game portfolio of. And super is at such a good place right now to buy. Beam is at such a good place to buy right now. It's down, I think, 70% from its all time high super versus a little bit more. And the thing about super is it stayed incredibly strong. It only capped out this year at $1.43. Now it's at $0.88. This thing just wants up. And everything that Elliot is doing over at super, the infrastructure has been building. This thing's about to go from being like one of the, like made coins to one of the top coins up here. So I would just. I'd be all in a super. Super is my biggest bag, by the way. And this is something I've been holding for just infinite amounts of time because I have ultimate faith in elite and what he's doing. Echelon prime also fantastic. If you want a good combination of AI and gaming, I think it's gonna be really happy as well. Neural AI combines gaming, AI together very good. Another coin I think is gonna do really well is going to be Cytus and cetify. Also close. Miri, is it such a good buy point as well right now? But Cytus and Ceta Phi, I'm having trouble finding Cytus right here. Are going to do super well because they encapsulate everything that's going on in gaming. These. These companies have just basically wrapped up everything that's doing well in crypto, AI, seed investing, game dropping, actual games. They've wrapped them all up in the coins that I think we're gonna. They have great pumponomics. That means they're gonna pump very well. When the run actually gets going big time, I think we'll get a lot of action. I don't own big time. I think illuvium will get a lot of action. And what you need to understand about gaming when these things actually start to tack off is all these coins down here. Like, this is. This is the real strategy. All right? You want crypto investing one on one. Step one, come the coin market cap. Step two, pick over hyped market. You see influencers talk about. Step three, scroll to the very bottom of the page. Go to page two. Yolo life savings into these coins. Okay, don't do that. But for real, that was a very valid strategy last run. That was. That was an excellent strategy. Fine coin related to gaming with terrible market cap. Throw money into it. And how could I forget right here? Carrot is going to be probably one of the biggest leaders. I have infinite faith in Carrot and then Cytus, like we mentioned before, is right here. Carrot's at an insane buy point. This is the stupidest market cap for a coin like this I've ever seen. You also pixelmon you up off the grid, coming out. You have Nian. It's stupid amount of good stuff that's coming. It's like, it's like we're at a soccer game right now, okay? And there's a guy kicking penalty kicks. And if he just makes one penalty kick, we all get outlandishly rich. But the thing is, he has 20 penalty kicks, so he just has to make one. Okay. If one of these games hits, it's gonna be juicy. And I think off the grid is going to lead the way in this. It's going, it's. It's very cool. Moontropica also has the meme edge behind it. Mutrapolo's at a great buy point right now, too. The team behind it's great. The colt, it is a cult behind it, I think is going to do very well. I'm going to get into more of these in the gaming video that's going to be here next week, so be sure to subscribe on top of that. Follow me on Twitter, Becker, because again, I mentioned what I'm looking at in industries and stuff like this way sooner on there. So that's where I'd be looking at. And that's, that's kind of the overview of what I think is about to happen in the market. To sum it up, bitcoin probably going to be pumping here really soon. If it doesn't, it's just going to not do anything for another six months, which is not great, but it, fine, we can wait. Utility coins are going to make a comeback. Solana, Avax and other coins I mentioned going to do very, very well. Get the infrastructure underneath it. I think uniswap is going to become ginormous as well. Big chunky top AI coins, just get them. IMX, super beam. Just get them. Look into those industries I talked about. If you followed that roadmap I just gave you, I think you're going to do so damn well in this run. And I think from these points right here, you can do almost what we did in November. Now look, November last year, no, ₩1, any chunk of crypto. So if you got in those prices when we did, you're still super up from them. Congratulations. But that, that wasn't the gain we were looking for. That that last pump we saw is not the gains we're looking for. The gains we're looking for are coming up right now. And while the buy points right now aren't as good as what we saw back then, they're really good. And crypto still has almost no mainstream interest. If you look at the search volume, views on YouTube, everything, people aren't playing yet. So I don't know how to put this in any other way. There's definitely a risk on the table right now, but you have to take a damn risk. And I think it's way riskier to be out of the market right now. So these are my thoughts on the market. I've been talking way too long. I don't have anything else to say. Follow me on Twitter at CSS Becker linked at the end of this video, there's an overview of my AI coins and there's also a big overview of crypto gaming that I made a few years ago before it's become huge. That will give you the whole download of what I'm thinking. Watch those videos. They're better than this one. This has been a real low quality banger. I got other things to do. Goodbye.",

    "summary": "## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility, with Bitcoin recently surging to nearly $95,000 before pulling back to around $86,000. This fluctuation was partly driven by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, which included Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies[2][3]. Despite these fluctuations, the overall market sentiment remains cautious, with many investors awaiting further developments in regulatory policies and market trends[1][5].\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin Outlook:** The speaker views Bitcoin as a key indicator for the broader crypto market. If Bitcoin rises, altcoins are likely to follow with significant gains[4].\n- **Altcoin Trends:** Altcoins like Solana, Avax, and Chainlink are highlighted as potential performers due to their utility and adoption in sectors like gaming and finance[4].\n- **Gaming and AI:** These sectors are seen as emerging opportunities in crypto, with Immutable X and other gaming-related coins expected to benefit from increased adoption[4].\n- **DeFi and Infrastructure:** Coins related to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and oracles, such as Uniswap, are also noted for their potential[4].\n\n## Notable Predictions & Risks\n\n- **Price Predictions:** The speaker suggests that altcoins could deliver 20-30x returns, though this is highly speculative and based on past bull runs[4].\n- **Risk Warnings:** There is a significant risk of losing money in crypto, with the speaker noting that 95% of investors typically lose their investments. It is advised not to invest more than one can afford to lose[4].\n- **Market Risks:** The potential for a recession or prolonged market stagnation is mentioned, though the speaker believes these outcomes are less likely given current market conditions[4].\n\n## Actionable Advice\n\n- **Diversification:** Investors are encouraged to consider a mix of established coins like Bitcoin and Ether, alongside riskier altcoins that could offer higher returns[4].\n- **Research and Caution:** It is emphasized that crypto investing is high-risk and requires thorough research. Investors should not follow advice blindly and should be prepared for significant volatility[4].\n- **Stay Informed:** Following reputable sources and staying updated on market trends and regulatory changes is crucial for making informed investment decisions[4].\n\n## Cryptocurrency Coins Mentioned\n\n- **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n- **Ether (ETH)**\n- **Solana (SOL)**\n- **Avax (AVAX)**\n- **Chainlink (LINK)**\n- **Uniswap (UNI)**\n- **Immutable X (IMX)**\n- **Filecoin (FIL)**\n- **Theta Network (THETA)**\n- **Polygon (MATIC)**\n- **Dogecoin (DOGE)**\n- **Cardano (ADA)**\n- **Tron (TRX)**\n- **Nier**\n- **Akash**\n- **Aos Echelon Prime**\n- **Neural AI**\n- **Cytus**\n- **Ceta Phi**\n- **Miri**\n- **Carrot**\n- **Pixelmon**\n- **Nian**\n- **Moontropica**\n- **Mutrapolo**",

    "transcript": "when ETH first started underperforming the bulls dismissed the bears with confidence after all history suggested that ETH would follow BTC's lead and eventually rally to new all-time highs but that confidence has faded now many are starting to worry that ETH's struggles could continue even to the point of eventual irrelevance eth holders everywhere are left asking the same question can it ever recover that's why today we'll break down exactly why ETH has been underperforming and whether the bulls might still have the last laugh my name is Guy and you are watching the Coin Bureau i'll start by saying that this video is purely for educational and entertainment purposes and nothing contained within is financial advice also note that some members of the Coin Bureau team hold ETH as part of their crypto portfolios including yours truly as always though we will remain objective in our analysis and if you want to see which other cryptos we hold and which ones we're considering buying then you can become a member of the Coin Bureau Club where you'll also find weekly reviews of promising small cap and midcap altcoins and daily alpha and insights from the Coin Bureau team and much more besides the link will be down in the description now unless you've been living under a rock you'll know that Ethereum's performance has been so poor that it's basically become a meme while BTC has rallied to new all-time highs everyone has been watching the second largest crypto by market cap waiting for it to make similar moves and well let's just say we're still waiting last March BTC broke above its previous all-time high of around $69,000 and then rallied to $19,000 before the recent retracement now this is significant because historically investors will rotate out of BTC and into ETH meaning that ETH's price action usually follows BTC's quite closely however at the time of shooting this video ETH has yet to reclaim its 2021 high of around $4,900 in fact Ethereum is one of the only major altcoins yet to experience any price movements for us to get excited about during this cycle ETH's price has struggled to break above the key resistance level of $4,000 significantly lower than its previous all-time high and what's more is that while the market overall has taken a beating lately ETH's price has fallen to levels last seen in the bare market yikes what's crazy though is just how much ETH has struggled against BTC considering that both are seen as monoliths in crypto both of them are go-to destinations for investors of all kinds be they retail or institutional both assets are even accessible to traditional investors as well since both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own US spot ETFs and yet you only have to take a look at ETH's price against BTC to see that Ethereum has been bleeding against Bitcoin since September 2022 with no signs of that slowing down all in all then it's not looking good bro oh and before we go any further if you're enjoying the video so far then punch that like button to show it who's boss slap that subscribe button too and be sure to drop kick that notification bell while you're at it so you don't miss our next update so then this begs the question of exactly why Ethereum has been struggling so badly in the eyes of many the biggest thing hurting ETH's price is the massive number of layer 2s within Ethereum's ecosystem now as you'll know Ethereum has long struggled with scalability and in fact Ethereum devs have been exploring ways to scale the network almost since it launched now the original plan was sharding wherein the Ethereum blockchain would be split into smaller chunks called shards however as Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buteran explained in a recent blog post these shards would be treated by protocols as different chains causing all sorts of issues for users and developers as such the focus has now shifted to a more modular architecture with Ethereum adopting layer 2 scaling solutions that can process transactions much faster and at a fraction of the cost this allows Ethereum to stay competitive against the so-called Ethereum killers which emerged last cycle and in some cases have been eating Ethereum's lunch this time around this modular architecture also adds additional flexibility to the overall network since each layer 2 can be customized for different use cases ironically enough though this has essentially caused the same issues as sharding with liquidity being severely fragmented many believe that liquidity fragmentation is the biggest reason why ETH's price has underperformed and layer 2 have arguably stolen some of the venture capitalist mind share too many VCs believe that investing in layer 2 infrastructure is one of the biggest opportunities in the crypto industry picks and shovels if you will and let's just say that Ethereum sharding wouldn't make it possible to launch new tokens that could then be dumped on retail now the other issue with layer 2s is that they add another uh layer of complexity and it certainly doesn't help that Ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem has become somewhat saturated to be blunt this isn't the best user experience especially when users can stick to other layer 1 blockchains to achieve the same if not better results apologies for the interruption folks but I very quickly want to tell you about the Coin Bureau deals page now if you're interested in things like discounts on hardware wallets money off trading fees and exchange signup bonuses then the Coin Bureau deals page is absolutely the place that you need to check out the link is in the description below these are some of the best deals and promos in all of crypto so check it out when you have a moment okay enough from me back to the video and this brings us to another challenge for Ethereum and that's the growing competition from those aforementioned Ethereum killers for anyone unaware these are smart contract blockchains that threaten Ethereum's dominance by effectively offering an alternative to Ethereum now some of the leading Ethereum killers by market cap include Salana BNB chain Aptos Avalanche and Sooie among many others in fact some of Ethereum's oldest competitors come from blockchains created by some of its earliest co-creators such as Gavin Woods Polka Dot and Charles Hoskinson's Cardano in any case all of these projects are different from one another but they all have something in common they all have lower transaction fees than Ethereum and can process more transactions per second this is why many of them have seen significant adoption with most rallying to new all-time highs this cycle while ETH has been left in the dust the crazy thing is that the difference between Ethereum and its competitors isn't even close despite its overwhelming dominance over the non-Bitcoin part of the crypto market Ethereum falls short against its rivals on numerous metrics for context Ethereum can theoretically process 119 transactions per second or TPS although it usually handles around 15 there's over 400,000 active Ethereum addresses at the time of shooting and over 1.1 million daily transactions ethereum has around $47 billion in total value locked or TVL the majority of which as we mentioned earlier is on its layer 2s on a more positive note Ethereum still has the most active developers of any blockchain and by a wide margin according to Electric Capital's developer report there are over 10,000 active developers working on EVM chains with more than 6,200 working on Ethereum itself so over 16,000 in total meanwhile Ethereum's biggest competitor is arguably Salana which can theoretically process up to 65,000 transactions per second with 1.3 second finality salana has 2.8 million daily active addresses and around $277 million daily transactions granted that most of these transactions are bots and Salana has a TVL of around $6.6 billion at the time of shooting the Salana ecosystem also has the second highest developer count with around 6,400 in total notably Salana became the first crypto to onboard more developers than Ethereum last year and it should come as no surprise then that Soul has had no problems rallying to a new all-time high reaching $294 in January of this year another example is Binance's BNB chain which can theoretically hit 2,222 transactions per second now this target is likely a reference to the number two being lucky in some cultures particularly in China in any case BNB Chain has around 1.2 million active addresses handles around 6 million daily transactions and has a TVL of around $5.3 billion bnb Chain also has a relatively modest developer account of 688 according to Electric Capital significantly fewer than either Salana or Ethereum meanwhile Aptos has an impressive theoretical max TPS of around 160,000 with subsecond finality aptos has around 3 million active addresses processes roughly 3.1 million daily transactions and has a TVL of around $974 million at the time of shooting apttos is also home to around $723 developers then there's Avalanche which currently has a maximum TPS of just under 1,200 although the upcoming Virick upgrade will push Avalanche's TPS all the way up to 100,000 avalanche has around 104,000 active addresses processes around 3.8 million daily transactions and has a TVL of around $1.1 billion avalanche also has a fairly low developer count at just 406 and of course there's Sooie which is so fast that not only is it a so-called Ethereum killer but many see it as a possible Salana killer too suie can theoretically process up to 297,000 TPS with sub-second finality it has around 78 million addresses processes around 14 million daily transactions and has a TVL of $1.1 billion suie also has a developer count of 760 which is actually quite impressive considering that the Sooie blockchain is a relative newcomer having launched in May 2023 with all that said though it's worth repeating that while these alternative layer 1 chains have some serious competitive advantages over Ethereum in many regards none have managed to overtake Ethereum in terms of adoption developer activity or even ecosystem size even with Ethereum's relative weakness there's still a long way to go before it's dethroned by any one of these rivals now Ethereum may have more than its fair share of competition in the blockchain world but another major challenge comes from the macro environment specifically high interest rates that's because higher interest rates are reflected in government bonds which are popular among institutional investors at the time of shooting the yield on US government bonds is 4.28% 28% meanwhile ETH staking offers a yield of just 3% this means that institutional investors who love earning a consistent yield are much more inclined to stick with government bonds as a result and what's more is that this has been the case for quite some time now that's because there seems to have been an inflection point around mid 2023 around this time ETH staking yields dropped below 4% and have been gradually falling ever since meanwhile US Treasury yields rose above 4% in July 2023 in retrospect this seems to have been when Ethereum's troubles began and this lack of institutional interest is also reflected in the spot Ethereum ETFs which have seen minimal interest relative to the spot Bitcoin ETFs that helped BTC rally to new all-time highs the biggest reason for this is likely because Ethereum ETFs currently lack a staking mechanism meaning there's nothing that really differentiates them from the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the eyes of many investors what doesn't help is that running an Ethereum validator is also quite a complex process that involves specific hardware requirements and a whole bunch of complicated code so this complexity combined with the lower yields than those available from US treasuries is likely a big part of why institutions would rather stick to US bonds quite frankly unless institutional investors are also Ethereum bulls or at least bullish on crypto as a whole there's no obvious reason why they would opt to invest heavily into an asset that offers a lower yield and is noticeably struggling to perform the caveat is that Ethereum is still the most secure smart contract crypto by a wide margin and this makes it the ideal place to tokenize realworld assets and that is exactly what asset managers are keen to do all in all then this paints a pretty bleak picture for Ethereum and ETH's price as a result at least in the short term however we happen to believe that this could all change and ETH's price could see a major recovery rally driven by multiple bullish factors one major tailwind for Ethereum is the recent change in leadership at the SEC since Gary Gendler stepped down as chair the SEC has taken a much more crypto-friendly approach towards the industry almost doing a complete 180 on its previously hostile stance this means that there's now a much higher chance of staked Ethereum ETFs being approved now these would potentially be a much more attractive product to investors since they would provide a simpler way to earn a yield on ETH and not only that but institutions could also become more comfortable with Ethereum's tech thanks to Etherealize for context Etherealize launched in January this year with the mission to drive Ethereum's institutional adoption on Wall Street etherealize will promote Ethereum to institutions by offering institutional-grade products that facilitate the tokenization of real world assets or RWAs now these RWAs include tokenized bonds commodities real estate and much more besides naturally then institutions are keen to integrate tokenized RWAs into their business models and Etherealize will promote Ethereum as the go-to blockchain for this meanwhile longtime Ethereum developer Danny Ryan has joined Etherealize as a co-founder working alongside Vivc Raman to promote Ethereum to Wall Street and it's not just Etherealize you may have seen that recently the Ethereum Foundation had a change in leadership which will likely benefit both the foundation itself and Etherealized stepping in to lead the foundation is Sao Wei Wang one of its core researchers and Thomas Stansac the CEO of Nevermind one of Ethereum's largest execution clients notably both have backgrounds in Tradfi now with the Ethereum Foundation under new leadership Ethereum's development could get an improved level of focus however it's unlikely that Ethereum's roadmap will shift away from those layer 2 as Vitalik himself has explained abandoning layer 2s means abandoning the many benefits they provide in his words quote \"We should stay the course continue to scale primarily through L2s but make sure that L2s actually fulfill the promise that they were meant to fulfill.\" And of course there's the upcoming Perra upgrade now Petra will implement over 10 Ethereum improvement proposals or EIPs mostly aimed at bringing more functionality to wallets and improving user experience one proposal in particular EIP7251 will increase the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 48 ETH now this will be immensely helpful to ETH whales like institutions and allow them to consolidate their positions across fewer validators giving them a much more convenient way to earn a yield that said we should point out that Perra was recently delayed after Ethereum developers noticed a few technical issues as such Perra will be trial on the Hudi test net while these issues are patched but all going well the PERA upgrade could go live on the main net as early as the 25th of April on the macro front meanwhile if interest rates begin to fall then US treasuries will have a lower yield as a result assuming that ETH's price begins to show some strength this would make ETH staking much more appealing as it happens the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates at least twice this year with the first cut expected sometime over the summer but back to the crypto side of things as we mentioned earlier many people believe that Ethereum's biggest hurdle is its layer 2 ecosystem however what many don't consider is that DeFi activity on these protocols continues to rise so while ETH isn't necessarily being used for fees it is being used more frequently as collateral and as a trading pair in other words the demand for ETH is still very much there just perhaps not in the ways that you might expect ultimately though this demand could translate to ETH's price rising as these layer 2 gain adoption so while ETH's chart may be painful to look at right now especially against BTC the bullish momentum building behind Ethereum suggests that better times may yet lie ahead let's just hope that's the case because well quite often it's felt like they couldn't get any worse could they okay folks if you enjoyed today's
