const str = `## Crypto Market Overview\n\nThe current cryptocurrency market is characterized by a mix of volatility and potential buying opportunities. The speaker in the YouTube video transcript suggests that the market conditions are similar to those seen during the FTX crash and COVID-19 pandemic, with many indicators flashing oversold signals. 
This environment is perceived as a good time to buy, especially for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as altcoins.\n\n## Key Investment Insights\n\n- **Bitcoin and Ethereum:** The 
speaker is bullish on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting that current prices offer a good buying opportunity. They believe that Ethereum needs to reach an all-time high for the market to fully recover 
and see significant gains.\n  \n- **Altcoins:** Altcoins, particularly those related to AI, RWA, and gaming, are highlighted as potential high-growth areas. However, these investments are considered riskier and require a longer-term perspective.\n\n- **Stock Market Influence:** The stock market's performance, influenced by factors like tariffs and economic policies, is seen as impacting the crypto market.`;
