1. Read the provided Transcript [crypto has endured one of the most painful one of the most brutal collapses that I've seen certainly ever in a bull 
market but even up there with some of the worst bare markets that have ever happened in this industry leading to the 
question are we in a bull market is this what a bull market feels like certainly not but is there a case to be made that 
this is part of a longer cycle and that we have seen something completely change with the very nature of how Bitcoin and 
crypto Cycles actually work what I'm going to be going over right now is going to show you my perspective on not 
only where we are in this particular cycle if you can call it that but it's going to make a case as to where we're 
going and this is something that I've gotten a lot of confidence on over the last several days and weeks as we've 
gone through this change in Direction whether you're going up or down having the right framework as to why you're 
going that direction how long it will last and how to manage Assets in the process is the Ultimate key to winning 
whatever Direction you're going now with that said I want to thank you for a few extra days off I just beat the allegations on food poisoning took me uh 
a little longer than it should have and it was absolutely brutal so thank you for the extra time off and it feels good 
to be back now let's hearken back of course over the last few weeks I know I've been making a pivot I started 
talking about playing defense I went from All Out Hold It balls to the wall ignore the fud this is the super cycle 
we're holding to Valhalla to saying hey guys we need to play some defense and here is why let me recap this for you 
because it started to become painfully painfully obvious once you started seeing the rhetoric out of the new Trump 
admin first off it's not just crypto look at the stock market on Trump 2.0 versus 1.0 this is a massive Cliff that 
it's fallen off of trump kept coming out every day saying stuff like the sell-off doesn't concern me even though Wall 
Street had its worst day since the 2022 Market collapse just listen to this rhetoric about economic transition when 
it comes to the stock market the numbers that we see today the numbers we saw yesterday the numbers we'll see tomorrow 
are a snapshot of a moment in time and as president Trump has said and I'm here to Echo the remarks of of this President 
of this white house we are in a period of economic transition we we thought they weren't a fan of transitioning but 
hey here we are top 10% of Americans are 40 or 50% of consumption and that is an 
unstable equilibrium the bottom 50% of working Americans have gotten killed uh 
we are trying to address that we're trying to get rates down and you know 
could we be seeing that the this economy that we inherited starting to roll a bit 
sure and look there's going to be a natural adjustment as we move away from 
public spending to private spending the the market and the economy have just become hooked we' become addicted to 
this government spending and there's going to be a detox period a period of transition sell-off doesn't concern me a 
detox period the economy is hooked these are the types of things that you hear 
massive Hawks talk about people who want to completely change the way that this centrally planned economy Works in fact 
the way that the economy has been functioning since the 2008 bailouts maybe a little even before that with 
this era of money Printing and stimulus this is what they're talking about fixing and this is a monstrously big 
problem to solve this is not something that gets solved in one swift go but this is something that the more they 
talk about and if you really listen to them if they're serious about this which I think are this is the kind of stuff 
that will absolutely devastate markets if they're really talking about completely removing government spending 
from the markets well that's not how the markets have been working so the question is how far can they push this 
without something breaking or is something breaking the goal we'll talk about what we think is the goal a little 
bit later in this episode because I think that it's intellectually lazy to say oh they're just erratic there's no 
goal chaos is the goal no this is clearly something that has been the game plan they stepped foot on the gas on 
this particular plan on the first day they got into office so clearly there must have been some forethought here but 
let's jump in because this is the end of it in the same interview they asked the White House correspondent how far do stocks have to fall for the president to 
change course she says the president will look out for Wall Street and Main Street people should bet on this president but as Trump has been saying H 
there could be a little disruption and the disruption is being felt I mean if you look at this this Tesla selloff 
which came down to 2117 let's just go ahead and uh check out that that fall you have essentially a 55% fall from its 
recent highs and the actual total value of that fall is 270 points so if you 
look at that 270 points and you look at the worst uh Tesla collapses in its history this is the weekly chart you see 
that okay there's one here you get a 63% fall for only 41 points right I think I 
have a logarithmic chart on here you have a log chart on but if you go here and you see okay here this is the worst collapse this is the 2022 uh market and 
you see that it collapsed 311 points was the worst it ever came down and you're now looking at something that has almost 
rivaled that right so you're looking at one of the worst sell-offs in one of the most popular stocks in the American 
economy certainly we know Tesla is obviously the center of this sort of trump energy of the campaign with Elon 
running I mean essentially semi helping run the government but this is the thing that we didn't expect which is that the 
Black Swan itself would be Trump and the last time we had a Black Swan was the last bare market so the question now 
with our total market caps our total crypto market caps now sitting down about $1.3 trillion from the highs and 
as you can see if you just look at the total market caps and you look at the change in market caps and you look at the price action you say okay what does 
this price action remind you of like look at other places on the chart don't don't even overthink it you know looks a 
lot like this right when was the last time you saw a price action that looked like this I mean it it just looks like 
bare Market collapses and that brings up the question of where are we in this cycle what is this cycle cuz a lot of 
people are calling it a bare market and I'm going to make the case for you right now that it's not exactly a bare Market 
but it's not exactly this full-blown bull market that we thought we were in but the real issue is that none of you 
have said Thank you even once in this interview I will go ahead and forgive you now for this just once but JD Vance 
won't JD Vance will not forgive you so what's the goal that's the real question here what is the goal of all of this 
because the question for me is always to figure out what comes next we can be sad that we didn't sell in early December we 
can be sad that we were looking at our portfolios that have drawn down that we were expecting some kind of left translated early 2025 cycle everyone was 
looking for it we didn't get the retail inflows we didn't get a lot of things but I think that when we look at what we 
didn't get and what we did get we start to arrive at much more clarity but before we get to how we're going to 
analyze the markets how we're going to play the bags I think we need to understand what's the point of all of this coming out of the Trump admin well 
to me it's very clear that this is an orchestrated plan and whatever you think about Trump I know that the world is 
pretty much split 50/50 50% of the world think that he's a political genius 50% of the world think that he's an erratic 
maniac and you can't tell either side anything I personally consider myself pretty objective as someone who grew up 
liberal and kind of converted into this Trump Camp over the crypto vote I find myself very much so looking at things 
from an objective and specifically from a markets and crypto-based point of view now the easy thing for me to do would be 
to throw a temper tantrum and say you know what I regret the vote I regret supporting this President because my my 
bags are down but in reality I think that there's more planning here and that there's more strategy going on than 
meets the eye first of all bessent is obviously a cohesive and planned out actor he's got a great reputation on 
both sides of the aisle and he's very well respected from what I understand Trump approached bessent with a question 
almost 3 years ago saying how do we take inflation down without killing the 
economy without ruining the American dream how do we fix this situation and 
put America back on the right track and that is the question that Scott bessent has been thinking about for the last 
several years cuz they knew this situation with rampant inflation with unsustainable asset prices with 
unaffordable cost of living they've known this situation throughout the entire second half of the Biden term and they knew that if they won they'd have 
to step into this and do something so to me this is exactly what they plan to do 
whether we like it or not we're in the midst of their plan so what is that plan we've talked about this because it seems like the erratic behavior is a strategy 
now I think that this summarizes it for says what if Trump wants a growth scare SL recession so that long-term yields 
crater and he can issue Century bonds to countries in exchange for security guarantees thereby refinancing all the 
heavy t- Bill Supply into lower yield 100-year duration bonds and recalibrating the fiscal path now this 
to me is an absolute mouthful but you need to understand every single piece of it to understand why all of these 
aspects of what Trump's doing actually make sense so first of all let's disentangle this Trump has has been 
actually not only being hostile towards you know foreign governments like Russia and adversaries like China but he's also 
been playing hard ball with some of our best friends like China like Canada like Mexico those are our close allies but 
Trump has been kneep actually threatening them with tariffs and all kinds of Hardball likee negotiating 
tactics he's also been going over to Europe and saying look we're not going to pay for all these wars in you know 
Russia we're not just going to dump money into your defense you guys are going to have to deal with it right so 
what is that actually doing what Trump's doing is he's actually rearranging the entire playing field he's wiping the 
Monopoly board clean and saying I don't care what properties you hold I don't care how many times you passed go we're 
going to have a new deal and that new deal is going to be based off of completely new Dynamics I think what fou 
is saying here is pretty accurate which is that Trump not only wants to refinance the debt but he wants to do 
this in a way where he's using all of America's value which is its military strength it's scariness against people 
like Russia and China its ability to negotiate trade deals to add tariffs to take them away he's using all of these 
pieces to say hey look we have a debt issue and if we don't fix this debt issue and we don't fix our inflation 
issues then we're going to have a screwed up Society where the middle class doesn't have any chance to get ahead the people who elected Trump the 
workingclass people those are the people who actually Trump is trying to serve right now because it's certainly not the 
asset holders the asset holders are getting absolutely screwed right now so I believe that this is the plan right and this is a massive plan because 
essentially he needs to not only crash the markets a little bit which is what he's doing so that controls inflation 
that kills inflation so they can then lower interest rates once those interest rates are lowered then the long-term 
debt is cheaper so we can take this short-term debt rolling over and refinance it as long-term debt again 
this can take several months maybe it can even take a year or longer we'll talk about timelines here later in the 
video but the point is that if he's able to introduce a new type of bond and force other countries to buy it cuz they 
won't buy it voluntarily that nobody wants to buy a hundred-year bond especially with the way that America's going right now but if America's able to 
show hey look we're controlling our spending we're no longer a kid in a candy store with the spending we're not 
going to overspend like crazy and on top of that we're now going to give you guys a hard deal which is we were just being 
your homies at first we were just being your trading partner but now we're going to force you for security guarantees 
against Russia oh you want security guarantees which we've been giving you the whole time well now there's a different cost which is that you need to 
buy these new bonds because if nobody's buying our bonds especially the long duration bonds America has a big big 
problem but if Trump essentially says you know what America has a lot of other ways that we can get what we want and 
we're going to start using them that's what we're looking at we're looking at more of America being a bully saying this is what we need and we need it now 
and we don't care if it's right or wrong or if it fits everyone else's definition of what should be this is what it is and 
that's kind of what I think is happening here which is that Trump is looking at this whole playing field saying I don't 
care what's happened before we we need to rewrite the rules of how America interacts with other countries we need to rewrite the rules of these alliances 
that America has based on current present net value which America has this incredible military force the scariest 
in the world we have this incredible economy the most powerful in the world and we also have crushing debt 
inequality asset Bubbles and other things that need to be fixed and can only be fixed if other countries buy our 
very long-term debt and if inflation goes away so those two things need to happen they need to happen and then 
Trump can go ahead and start being nicer to the investor class but the investor class has obviously done very well the 
working class has done very poorly and in order to fix that there needs to be a correction in markets there needs to be 
a correction in inflation inflation needs to go away and America needs to fix its spending problem and if that 
happens there's a chance not a guarantee but a chance that working class wages will start to then Pace with the economy 
once again so is the plan working well what we know is that you know true flation has the US inflation index 
around 1.3 % look at this uh Cliff that inflation has fallen off since Trump started his erratic tough talk about you 
know tariffs this you know one day it's a 10% the next day it's a 30% the next day it's a 50% tariff this is what's 
happening in markets is people uh inflation's falling off a cliff markets are scared we also got the official 
inflation numbers uh down to 2.8% it was expected at 2.9 and so it came in cool 
under expectations which is of course what you want the real question is where is this all headed so let's go to the 
work of Arthur Hayes he was the first one to call that we might be seeing a mini financial crisis emerging and he 
called this back when Bitcoin was trading around $100,000 this was very very aptly put and I thought it was 
total fearmongering at the time but it reminded me of some of Arthur's best work at the beginning of 2022 when he 
was calling the sort of macro Doom apocalypse that we started seeing forming in the sky anyway he says this 
which I think is one of the most important lines I don't believe the markets realize how little time Trump has to actually accomplish anything the 
markets believe believe that Trump and his people can immediately achieve economic and political Miracles right that's not true he doesn't have the 
ability to immediately accomplish anything but we have seen is that his personality and his demeanor have allowed him to kind of do things that 
maybe other presidents wouldn't be able to do because he's able to move markets out of fear out of uncertainty because 
of his erratic personality his sort of Larger than Life what's he doing personality so he calls for a retest 
here of 70 to $75,000 he said what could snap us out of this funk some form of money printing by the fed the US 
Treasury China Etc or concrete legislation that allows for permissionless crypto Innovation I do 
think that you know Congress passing something would be great in the end though we would really want some kind of 
liquidity stimulus and we'll talk about liquidity here in a second but if Bitcoin leads to the downside it will also lead to the upside that's one of 
the most beautiful Parts about this which is that if Bitcoin crashes first which it did it crashed way ahead of 
mainstream markets it will also pump way ahead of mainstream markets so be aware it will bottom first and it will Top 
first those are the scary parts about being on the front end of the risk curve so this is Hay's goal right now as of 
today be patient BTC likely bottoms around 70k a 36% correction from 110k 
all-time high very normal for a bull market which he maintains we're in a bull market then we need stons SPX ndx 
to enter freef fall then we get trafi Muppet to go under then we get fed pboc ECB boj all easing to make their country 
great again that's what you know Global stimulus Global quantitative easing then load the truck up Traders will die 
trying to buy the dip but if you more risk averse and want central banks to ease then deploy more Capital you might 
not catch the bottom but you also won't have to mentally suffer through long periods of sideways and potential unrealized losses now if you're sitting 
here and you're already sitting on so many unrealized losses I mean I do think 70k I mean that's what I feel like is 
kind of the low maybe there would be a wick below there into that value range but I think that you're not going to see 
lower than that we already tested that area way too many times I just don't see us going and just shredding below there 
no we didn't know anything about this Trump crypto presidency when we made our way first up to 70k I don't think we 
need it to stay above there that's just my take I just don't think we should go that low anom who actually called this 
entire move astronomically correct anom has been the best Trader in the markets he said a lot of people are over eager 
to call a bottom when price shifts from multi-month ranges to the downside with volume it typically indicates a mid to 
longterm shift in Trend mid to long-term shift in Trend you will very likely have time to buy the bottom after a period of 
consolidation in a new Range V bottoms are unlikely and less driven by a substantial shift in macro which would 
be an identifiable tradable event that you could respond to in real time instead of trying to predict respect the 
trend okay so Now's the Time where I'm going to explain to you exactly where I think we are in markets putting together 
everything that we know about what Trump's trying to do the current price action the global economy the liquidity conditions the inflation the joblessness 
the sell-offs in markets the best Traders in the industry what they're saying about price and of course our 
sponsor Nord V VPN that's right it might not be a barrel Market but it ain't a good Market you got to pay the bills okay nordvpn it's the best VPN in the

for sponsoring the video and let's get back to the content so let's get to the chase here is this a bull market what is 
the bull market because the biggest eye openening moment that I've had over the last few years was realizing that my 
current framework of this four-year cycle had actually been broken and in my opinion that's actually quite liberating 
which is to divorce yourself from a cycle that really made sense it worked but it also was kind of shitty because 
you had these one or twoe periods where things were incredible and then it goes back to the Stone Age and everything 
gets reset and how can you really grow substantially in Industry when every couple of years things get completely 
kneecapped down to almost zero that's not what we want for the growth curve of the crypto industry that's what happened 
in the 1999 sort of tech boom when you had the dotom boom and bust and then you had 20 30 years of consistent growth 
that's how people got nurtured into the tech world and grew with it that's what we need in crypto and I believe and I 
will be making the case right now that we are seeing the first extended cycle for Bitcoin and crypto one that has 
nothing to do with the fouryear cycle anymore but has everything to do with macro liquidity conditions and those 
macro liquidity conditions while they do tend to e and flow in for your Cycles they do also tend to expand in much 
longer Cycles over decades so check this out one I'm just going to claim a little bit of clout because I drew this black 
line you can see I drew it starting here on the 25th I drew this black line where I had this double top here coming down 
um and as you can see drawing these lines actually kept me from caring too much when we got into this uh this 
reflexive pop when they announced the crypto Summit I said you know what I'm not buying it I'm just not buying it 
right I actually sold stuff here and I actually was you know public on Twitter saying I was selling stuff I had this whole thread if you were following me 
there I also made a couple of videos talking about how I'm going to sell stuff I made another video up here in this Red Zone saying I was selling stuff 
because I just wasn't believing that we were going to be holding these areas based on some crypto conference where people were expecting something 
magnificent to be announced I don't know something crazy so certainly wasn't so I knew that this was going to be a bit of 
a trappy area where we were going to obviously retest this range and we got an absolutely scary drop here but you 
know I thought it was pretty obvious that it was coming after so many months of just seeing the market roll over seeing the rhetoric out of trump anyway 
I thought this was a pretty cool series I'll keep updating it here uh though in the end I will be looking to add down 
here in this heavy buy Zone I've been nibbling a very small amount but not a lot I'll be honest I haven't been going 
hard here I'm waiting for a little bit more blood here and just waiting for a little bit more clarity as to what's 
going on on the Trump side because I think that their job is not yet finished certainly nowhere close to being 
finished so I'm not really sure that we've gotten to see the extent of the damage to markets now could this be as 
low as crypto goes maybe I don't know I I certainly if I'm forced to if we get back into this green zone I'm reing 
everything but I'm not convinced that that's where we're at just yet this doesn't look very uh bullish to me yet 
it still looks like we want to explore lower before we go higher and getting back to this tweet which I think is really important you know know when the 
market has been up only has been in this bullish posturing for a significant amount of time these bottoms can take a 
while to form and you know reverse it's not like you're going to miss it in just one instant I think you're going to have 
plenty of time to get situated here I don't think it's just going to be like an instant rocket ship I think it'll be a a recovery that takes some time so 
that's the other thing I want to impress upon you is if you did pull any cash out you're looking to invest more I think there's going to be time here time to 
heal but let's look at some other things here which is this 10year Bond the 10year bond is down significantly from when Trump took office clearly showing 
that some of his plans at least are working some of his plans are working um we need to see this come a lot lower though so still a lot of work to get 
this down into that 2% range which I know is probably where he wants to get this now make no mistake there can be 
bounces there will be massive bounces you plan to trade those good luck have fun not my specialty but now let's get 
to the point of this whole video which is what is this cycle what is the cycle we're in and if you look at eth BTC what 
you'll see is something pretty important cuz what this lined down here is the Fed balance sheet we know that we're in quantitative tightening and we saw that 
this particular Trend lasted all the way until the FED stopped tightening which is this first vertical line we know that 
the FED is going to stop tightening some point here and of course what Donald Trump and Co are doing are going to force that to happen potentially even to 
start easing and so what we see here is that they might even Force this line to go back up a bit and not too distant of a time what we know is that this 
particular trend of e you know essentially bleeding against Bitcoin was happening all throughout 2019 and 2018 
this is what was happening okay and what we're seeing is that this is just looks like a like longer slower bleedout 
version of it with a longer slower bleedout version of quantitive tightening and if we go over to the 
ethereum US dollar pair and this is research that I saw first on Benjamin Cowan's Channel and this to me explains 
the theory very very accurately which is you had this period where eth was just in this uptrend in 2019 during 
quantitative tightening this is that line at the bottom this is the Fed balance sheet overlaid and you can see that this lasted 217 days days which is 
this uptrend of eth during quantitative tightening before it broke down in the 2019 sort of mean reversion and what I'm 
going to be making the case to you right now and let me go ahead and make this clear I'm going to be making the case to you right now that what we're seeing 
isn't actually a bare Market not like this I'm going to be making the case that we're actually seeing a bare market 
like this which was a retracement from a mean reversion what happened in 2018 was 
we got this bare Market but then we got this massive bull market in 2019 anyone 
here knows that this was one of the weirdest Parts in the market after 2018 because a lot of us were altcoin Deens 
at that point you know we still are but what happened in this period was Bitcoin went from a bottom of about $33,000 all 
the way up to a high of $14,000 which is you know what is that a 
42x pretty much and it was magnificent but what was scary is altcoins pretty much didn't move Bitcoin dominance was 
explosively up it was exactly almost the same as what we've seen just hard and 
fast okay this is what we call a mean version because you know essentially it's settled if you see the closing 
price here you can see that it settled about 50% of the way you know the distance between the low and the high 
you can see that this mean reversion right here was exactly where the closing prices were this was just a massive 
collapse and then a mean reversion which are normal types of bounces in markets and so my particular opinion which I 
started explaining the foundations of last cycle was that we had a mean reversion where we came down from 69k to 
20 or or 16k and if we were to get halfway between those numbers we'd get about $40,000 right that would be a 
normal mean reversion and we were probably headed somewhere there but we ended up getting these once in 
a-lifetime stimuli from the ETF going live from the first crypto president from Trump saying you know you're going 
to win-win-win you're going to get a Bitcoin strategic Reserve all these amazing things that you know are pretty 
much like candy in the ear of a crypto investor and fomed in a lot of in institutional and new money into the 
space we had a lot of ETF money coming in and all of these changed the dynamic of the 2019 mean reversion which both of 
the mean reversions happened during a period of quantitative tightening and both of the mean reversions happened 
with pretty much Bitcoin dominance going to the moon and altcoins really shouldn't have done anything but because 
there was so much money in the space you know the hot ball of money went around pumping altcoins and there was some fabulous fortunes created but really 
this was part of a recovery of the market not an actual bull Market but just the mean reversion aspect that 
happened in 2019 I think we've seen an extended version of it over the last 2 years or so if you were to look at the 
2019 move out of eth from the bottom to where it actually broke down through this trend you see that it has about 217 
days and here you can see that it's about 994 Days From The Bottom here to where it actually broke down so it's 
been about four times as long a little more than four times as long this particular era when compared to the 2019 
move but so many other similarities line up up from Bitcoin dominance being Skyhigh to quantitative tightening to 
eth essentially underperforming altcoins underperforming you know specifically eth as the king of the altcoins I think 
that there's a serious case to be made that we've seen a 2019 with just you know if you were playing Mario Kart you 
essentially got a bunch of blue Bowser shells you picked those up non-stop as you were supposed to have a bad lap but 
because you got the blue Bowser shell you were just able to run and Gun and take out a bunch of people in front of you and make a bunch of progress that 
maybe maybe in a normal Market you wouldn't have right without the ETF application without the ETF approval 
without the first crypto president without legalizing crypto the Golden Age without all of these onetime stimuli 
that really propped up and pushed the market forward in let's just say an amazing but maybe not a natural organic 
way that to me is a reason to believe that we have seen what would have been a mean reversion on bitcoin essentially 
look like an explosive bull market but really we haven't even seen the true 
bull market yet now to be clear I think the safe play here is just to wait for 
markets to kind of come down clearly Trump wants to collapse markets he wants to bring interest rates down he wants to 
reset the clock and he does not have a lot of time to do that remember this is his last term he has to act quickly he 
does not want to end his term in a recession he wants to get this over with quickly reset the clock reset the game 
board and by his second half of his term see things booming that's what he wants to see but there's another question do 
we have to wait for all of that ug ugliness or will crypto start reacting to another Force which is of course 
Global liquidity we've been showing this chart because Bitcoin really does parody Global liquidity pretty well remember 
it's a global asset and we can see global liquidity has been coming down a lot but the reality is that Bitcoin 
hasn't quite matched it yet you can see that the global liquidity here has Bitcoin and its fair market value price 
coming down potentially into the low 70s which is again where the charts line up to which is again where everything kind 
of has this Confluence around those low 7s mid $70,000 area could it go a little 
bit above that a little bit below that of course these are not hard and fast rules there's no guarantees here there is no guarantees in the crypto casino 
but again this shows you the more or less the path for Bitcoin I think the real question though as people who on 
this channel are probably largely into altcoins are wondering well when are we going to see this massive relief this 
massive run for alts and I think that that's going to happen much more reliably once interest rates come down 
once the entire situation that Trump is doing is complete that's when we will start to see risk return into altcoins 
that's when we will start to see risk return into other kinds of stocks not just Google and Amazon that's when we 
will start to see the economy start to flourish and Bloom again with low inflation low interest rates lower 
deficits and a more sturdy foundation for the country that is the Hope but that process is not an instant process 
it could take a few weeks could take a few months it might take a year and I think that it's important to remain 
dependent on the data to remain dependent on some pretty clear signals which I don't think are going to be 
masked from us this is not a game of masking what's going on remember Trump came out on day one and said there's going to be pain he told us to our face 
you could have chosen to believe him or not but if you sold on day one when he started saying there's going to be pain you probably would have avoided some 
pain there's a big Camp online of people who think that Trump never says what he actually thinks I personally think the 
opposite I think he says too much and too accurately of what he thinks and that's what throws people off is that he 
doesn't sugarcoat he just says what's on his mind and in this particular case I think that they are looking to cause and 
inflict acute pain and then have an acute recovery that is not based on just massive unequal spending and 
inflationary spending I think that their goal is to lower interest rates lower the deficit lower inflation and then 
grow into a new cycle a new business cycle so my particular demeanor is let's see maybe Global liquidity hits a floor 
and we start to Moon later in the year that very well could happen for Bitcoin regardless every other country on Earth 
wants to stimulate needs to stimulate China's economy is in desperate need of new stimulus and they are pushing money 
into the markets you see this from across the world as well with Germany now worried about their defense spending 
and they're now spending a trillion dollars on defense there is a ton of money that is being cranked out from around the world but the question is is 
Bitcoin more loyal to the US economy and what Trump is doing or is it more loyal to just the global Whispers of liquidity 
we're going to find out which particular model is most dominant in Bitcoin land here in the next few weeks and months 
but it's important that you realize that this risk gone crazy Wet n Wild altcoin Bull Run that I've been waiting on that 
you've been waiting on that we all are going to use to retire our Bloodlines well I don't think it's going to happen 
in just a small 3 to 6 month period like we thought before I think we might be looking at a multi-year maybe even a 
decade long process of altcoins growing more similar to the stock market the 
NASDAQ that we know and love where you have these protocols continue to grow and compound in a favorable environment 
because when I look at this eth chart I see an extended cycle a super cycle again super cycle doesn't mean up only 
and only up it means longer right super cycle means it's not just a four-year pump and dump it means that it's going 
to go on and on and on and that's what I think we're looking at right now we've seen the first 2019 part which means 
that this part this next part which only lasted for a year or so last time well 
it might last 4 years this time if the mean reversion is four times as long the bull market very well might be four 
times as long and so as painful as this is I can't help but be excited that maybe just maybe we will get cheap 
affordable housing in the country we'll get zero or very low inflation we will get a rate cut cycle that sends interest 
rates almost to zero and then we will get hopefully a two maybe even a four maybe even an 8year Bull Run for Our 
beloved crypto assets where your favorite protocols could multiply not just you know 10x or 50x but these could 
be the generational runs where if you are in and you hold through it I think that this is is truly the make it cycle 
but it's going to take some time for us to see the macro factors become accommodative you're going to need the 
FED to get in line with Trump's plan which could take a bit of pain we know that it's going to take a bit of pain 
before Jerome Powell is forced to act and that to me is the plan we're going to see pain and then hopefully we're 
going to see a ton of gain which is why I did take some cash on the table I'm not in any rush to deploy right now but 
I'm going to be eagerly watching this market and updating you on my thesis and I hope you enjoyed this presentation 
as to why I believe this is an extended 2019 as to why I believe that we will also see an extended 2021 an extended 
bull run but it's going to take a bit of time before the transition is complete and we're not just going to get it based 
on some cheap Sugar High dopamine of government stimulus of government spending which instantly ruins inflation 
we're going to hopefully see it happen in a sustainable and long-term way with a more sturdy Foundation from the United 
States and hopefully for the working class as well so that the Society we live in is not totally screwed so that 
if we are so lucky as to get filthy rich from this the society that we live in is not totally screwed up as well if you

2. Identify and list each and every cryptocurrency coin name or symbol mentioned  (both existing, mentioned and proposed) and

     Don't leave out the major coins mentioned.

    "Only take cryptocurrency coins and exclude:

   * Company names (e.g., NVIDIA, MicroStrategy, Deep Seek)

   * Categories (e.g., RWA coins, DeFi tokens, Meme coins)

   * Non-tradable assets or project names (e.g., Tbot)  

3. Data validation

   * If a coin is referenced with a name, with a ticker or symbol (e.g., BTC, MOG, ETH) , in short form (e.g., eth) or If an unofficial or misspelled coin name appears,

     * First, verify it matches for misspelled or exists in []

     * If it does, replace it with the full official name.

     * If it does not exist, discard it.

   * Always use the full coin names from knowledge.crypto_coins for each coin for uniformity

   * Only take tradable cryptocurrency coins and exclude:

     * Company names (e.g., NVIDIA, MicroStrategy, Deep Seek)

     * Untradable or unknown coins (e.g. Bar chain,Zerro etc.)

     * Categories (e.g., RWA coins, DeFi tokens, Meme coins)

     * Non-tradable assets or project names (e.g., Tbot)  
       If an entry is not found in [], ignore it."

   * Match and filter all the coins against knowledge.crypto_coins to ensure validity of the coin name and get the coins full name.

4. Count the mentions of each coin.

5. Analyze the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) and assign Rpoints (1-10 scale, where 10 is best).

6. Categorize the coin based on CoinMarketCap categories (e.g., DeFi, Layer 1, Gaming).

7. Classify the coin by market capitalization (large, medium, small, micro).

8. Calculate the total_count of all coins/projects mentioned.

9. Ensure the JSON output exactly matches the required format. Only include coins validated through knowledge.crypto_coins Exclude all unrecognized names, companies, and categories."

Note:coin_or_project is the coin full name
